34,"???tEuthanasia Should Be Legalized in China While euthanasia is more and more popular and even legalized in some countries,it still remains a fresh phenomenon in China.It is only practised in some big cities and hot debates are centred around whether it is moral or not and whether it should be legalized in China or not.Euthanasia is a mercy killing which can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occure naturally and quickly.In my opinion,no matter for the patient's own sake or from the relatives'and the society's aspects,euthanasia is moral and should be legalized in China.It is almost a certain choice when you are asked to choose between a painful death and a peaceful one.No one is willing to die in agony and degradation.Dignity and peace instead are wanted.From this aspect,that is also one of the reasons why so many people in China are so preoccupied with Confucians and Taonism.They want to learn from them the way to treat life and death,and then to gain a tranquil mind.The way most monks die is admired by people They die with peaceful and satisfied smile on their faces,for they have accepted death as the law of life.""Death should not be viewed as a failure,but as a normal and natural stage of life""People have the right to die.""Someone said that,when your life is threatened by a terminal illness,when you are tortured by the illness endlessly in great pain,when you no longer have the strength to enjoy the sweetness of the life,death will come to you as the best choice,for life is meaningless to you.As death is the inevitable fate in the end,why shouldn't we choose to die in dignity and peace?why should we still have to suffer the pain of life?Euthanasia,as the relief of pain,give the last choice to life and dignity to the patient.Along with the relief of the terminally ill patient is the relief to their family members,both mentally and physically.Let me put you in a hypothetical situation.Suppose you have a brother dearest to you.One day he was found to have a terminal lung cancer.He began to lose weight and lose hair.You witnessed he became thinner and thinner and the blood on his face was faded.What's more,he was no longer able to smile to you and play together with you.His laughter no longer appeared in the house,instead that were his painful groan and struggle between life and death.It would become a great torture to you.Can you endure to see your beloved brother to suffer so much,being unable to live or die?You would like to end his pain the sooner the better,for you were mentally and physically worn out by this time.You stayed all day long around his bed taking care of him,hoping he could recover.But day went on,what you could do was to see him worse and worse and help nothing.As death was the final fate of your brother,why not let him die peacefully?Euthanasia can give an end to your painful life as well as your brother's.Promoting euthanasia also do good to the society.It is not doubt that it would cost a lot of money to treat a terminally ill patient.Though it is of no use,money and energy are still put to prolong the life.This can be regarded as a waste of energy and money,since death would not be pushed out of door just because of your effort and hope.You are just making an artificial life that is useless.So why not choose to let that patient go naturally and save your money and energy to put into another patient with hope to life?This can help many ill people recover in China since China is so large a country with large population.Someone may still argue that the pratise of euthanasia will provide the opportunity to the criminals to make the euthanasia legalized.Once it is legalized and perfect in China,the criminal will have no leak to take,since law will do its justice to people.Euthanasia has many advantages no matter to the patient,the family members or the society.We should help the people understand them and pratise it in China,and make it legalized and perfect in form.",6
35,"Charm is one complicated feeling you get from another person.You would like to contact with a charming human,even you love him(her)and want to make friends with him(her).In daily life there are so many persons you have to face,and you could be aware of the difference of charm among them.Though charm is one real feeling that everyone knows,it's hard to tell why one person is charming but another not.So I want to set an example which is helpful to discover the causation.In my living environment,my most charming person is my tutor.Before I became his student,I knew little of him and just heard that he was a famous economist.At that time tutor was just an abstract existence and my feeling to him was neutral.Keeping contact with my tutor for one year,he has been more and more charming to me.I like him so much that I would like to work for him without any payment.Of course not only myself but also many other persons including many local and central leaders think he is charming.Then I ask myself why my tutor is charming?Because of his being handsome,or his great academic achievement?I think these are not main reasons,in fact his most attracting feature is his noble spirit.He works hard for people'life and the national development.He engages himself to seek a powerful road of China at the expense of his health and family happiness.Besides,another important reason is that he is kind to persons especially his students.From the experience from my tutor,I conclude that charm comes from a person's characters which could be divided into external characters and inherent characters.External characters such as pretty appearance and repute could bring on charm,many young fellow admire famous singers and film stars who are usually pretty or But those are not the most important reasons,in fact,the charm from external characters could not last a long time.The real and most important reason of charm comes from inherent characters such as temperament,ability,spirit.Napoleon was ugly,but he had marvelous talent and strong volition,and he was so charming that many people adore him two hundred years later after his On the contrast,if a man has handsome appearance,but he is ugly,short of perseverance and useless to society,then would you think he has charm?One person should not complain his being absent of charm because his parents haven't given him handsome face and graceful stature.Since charm comes from inherent characters,you could get charm through your efforts.Cultivate your temperament train your ability and educate your mind day after day,then you would become more and more charming.My dormitory I live in a very small dormitory,Room604in Building26.It is only about10centimeters,crowded with three double beds,one bookcase,one desk and three students including me.Our dormitory is not only a small one but also a disordered one.Once you burst through the door(we often forget to lock it up)and came into the room,you will not consider the room as a student's dormitory.This is because you can not find anything formal.The three beds seems widely divergent The first bed you will see on the left hand is covered with a gray and dusty mosquito-curtain throughout the year,which is so opaque that nobody can dope out whether or not there is any people in it.On the right hand,the bed is quite different from the first one,it is too neat and clear to be impressive.Behind the first bed,the bed close to the window is mine.My bed is always filled with a lot of books like rubbish,I can't deal with them,so I have never been living in my bed for several mouths My dormitory I live in a very small dormitory,Room604in Building26.It is only about10centimeters,crowded with three double beds,one bookcase,one desk and three students including me.Our dormitory is not only a small one but also a disordered one.Once you burst through the door(we often forget to lock it up)and came into the room,you will not consider the room as a student's dormitory.This is because you can not find anything formal.The three beds seems widely divergent:The first bed you will see on the left hand is covered with a gray and dusty mosquito-curtain throughout the year,which is so opaque that nobody can dope out whether or not there is any people in it.On the right hand,the bed is quite different from the first one,it is too neat and clear to be impressive.Behind the first bed,the bed close to the window is mine.My bed is always filled with a lot of books like rubbish,I can't deal with them,so I have never been living in my bed for several mouths.A another reason for my dislike of my dormitory is that there is a leak in the roof,the rain will come in from it.To my surprise,the building was built only few years ago!Our dormitory is not perfect,but compared with the ones of the undergraduate's,it is luxury.I have no right to complain about it,after all,the number of Tsinghua students is too large.",5

39,"teracota is very famous and has attracted many travellers all over the world.Guilin's waters and mountain also help the city to make a lot of money.That's to say,the income of the tourist cites depends on tourism.Most of the citiesI've evenvisited are developing cities,such as Jiangmen and Huizhou.They can hardly give you any impression because they themselves have few features.Anyway,they're devoloping so fast that we couldn't look down upon them.Huizhou,the little city in Guang dong,now has attracted many foreign funds capital funded enterprices.All these are the cities have visited in China.I hope that some dayI can have chances to visit cities in the west.I've been to Zhong shan University for several times.WhenI contrasted it with GUFL,whichI'm now studying at,it showed a great difference.all,zhong shan Univerdity gave you a more comfortable feeling than GUFL did.In order to identify it completely we can try to make contrast about their fame,area,environment,teaching facilities and entertaining facilities.No doubt,Zhong shan University enjoys much greater fame than GUFL does.It's one of the most famous universities in south China,evena foreign knows it and shows great interest when mentioning it.I'm sure that GUFL couldn't be so attractive.some people in Guang zhou haven't heard of the name of GUFL before and some know,but they don't know where to find it.On the contrary,you can easily find Zhong shan University in Xingang Road.In area,GUFL is apparently much smaller than ZU.We don't have to know the exact number.You can just traveral around the two niversities and contrast the time you use.Definitely it costs you much time to traveral the whole ZU,while GUFL,quite a little time.We can find that half of the area in GUFL is covered by teachers'buildings.That's quite different from the situation of ZU.With the help of Baiyun Hill,GUFL provides a beautiful scene to s---trees and flowers are seen all around.But that's pure natural scene,not the scenes at ZU,such as the man-made lakes,which are very beautiful and clean.ZU does better in the pretection of environment.The roads in ZU are usually kept tidy,while we can often see dust on the roads in GUFL.definitely it needs improvement on the hand.The main reason why ZU can enjoy a good fame comes from its perfect teaching and entertaining facilities.Its library is the largest of all university libraries in Guangdong.Ying dong studuim,which was built with Mr.Huo Ying dong's funds is also the most attractive and practical one in Guangdong.When turning back to GUFL's poor library and its football field,which is overed by high grass,we have to shake our heads with pity!We annot evenfind a good playground here in GUFL to hold a sportsmeet!In general,ZU provides a more comfortable situation to its studens and GUFL,still needs many improvements.A Friend is a person who shares the same feelings of natural liking and understanding,the same interests,etc.It can be divided into two:close friends and common friends.A close riend can share many thoughts with you,evenhis/her ecretsIn addition,they have the same or similar feeling on sth When your friend was sad or uncomfortable,you had no reason to be happy man.You should feel sad or uncomfortable too and more or ss release your friend's sadness.But that's impossible for a common friend to do---they evendon't know when you're sad and hen you're happy.They just past their greetings while meeting with you.That's quite different from what a close friend shows.In addition,you see a friend more regularly or often than some one else,so that you have more time to exchange your feelings and you points of view,especially when you are close friends.so people we also can meet regularly or quite often,but they might not be our friends.example,we meet some of our teachers almost everyday,but not all of them can be our friends.Sometimes we evenhate them.In this case we meet to have classes,not for the purpose of making friends.""A friend in need is a friend indeed.""Those who cannot help you solve your problems aren't called""A FRIEND.""A real friend will try his best to help you---this kind of help is based on faithfulness,not on money or some other benefits.Generally,a friend will always support you and fight with the difficulties and your opponents together with you.But if necessary,he will fairly point out your mistakes to help you improve and make more progress.A real good friend can share bed with you without fearing that you will kill or hurt him at the midnight.One dayI chatted with my close friend Denise in the institute.We sat side by side on a bench.Suddenly,she cried in joy""Look!Cat!""Then a loudly yellow cat with brown stripes on its body was seem jumping down from the roof of a store beside us.""How fat and lovely it is!""Denise said,with her eyes twinkling.""Yes,""I was surprised""Do you like cats too?""I thought that normally girls would like dogs better than cats.""Certainly,I loved them whenI was still a little girl.We evenfed a cat which resembles that cat in appearance at that time,so that it recalled me of my cat whenI saw that cat just now.""She became more and more excited.""I know.But you haven't concerned about your cat before.How is it now?""She turned her face and said in sadness:""She has been dead."" ""I'm sorry...Because of illness?""I asked.""Maybe,She didn't eat anything althoughI fed her with much delicious food.And we had to see her growing thiner and thiner Later,she got dead.""Denise said in a nearly trembly voice.I know the mood that she was in.""So that you evendidn't knew hat she died of,right?""Denise slightly nodded her head.""She has gone.""I noticed that she was staring at the cat which had the similar appearance of hers,and now ran away.No doubt,she was referring to it.""It's a pity that we don't wave veterinnarians here.""I continued.""Yes.AndI wishI were,but...""she stopped and sighed.""Life is life.There is something we cannot espect,""I was trying to comfort her.""I asked to feed4cats altogether.I loved them more and more,and,spent most of my spare time playing with them.But they were lost or killed by others.I hate the people who treat my cats so cruel!You seem to be comparatively lucky,right?"" ""Yes,""Denise sighed again and said.""Why can't the animals be treated as equally as us human-beings?"" ""Ha ha.""I laughed,""That seems not possible yet.But let's wish that some day in the future it will come true.Well,I have something to do now.See you next time."" ""See you"".Then we left.Describing A Person:When the sun was shining in the middle of the sky.Gary looper,an American cop,appeared on the street again.Under the yellowish setting of the late nineteen century constructions,his black uniform was very eye-catching.The shing silver medal was hung on the left of his waiste-coat indicating his identity.Now and then he put his right hand upon the pistol tied on the belt.The gun was so heavy together with big hand that the belt sloped to the right a little.But at the moment he seemed totally unaware of the weight on his waist,heading to the police office.Under the smart velvet hat was his clear-cut feature:keen eyes,dark eye brows,straight nose and the firm and dignified jaw.His age was not a secret,for everal white hair behind his ears and the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes revealed it.he looked serious.His eyebrow frowned and his mouth tightly shut.He had a well-built figure and a straight back,from which one could conclude he had used to be a handsome young man and popular among the community.Even though today his youth had faded with years,his popularity remained,not because of his apperance but because of his trust-worthiness.His pace was always steady and his hands mere always powerfully moving with rythmn while he walked.His typical walking style had been so will-known that whenever the residents spoted a man with long leg walking in this way,even50feet away,they could assume that:Gary Cooper was coming.Nov.8th.An early morning,a father with his two little girls has arrived at the gate of the hospital,waiting to visit his wife who has just given birth to a boy.It is still early;the locked iron with wire screen looks like a stern guard,resolved o separate the hospital and the outside world.A scarlet number27is printed on the wall,contrasting the grey pavement.In the chill breeze,the thickly-dressed family are all looking inside the hospital earnestly.A lovely girl,about two years old,is sitting on his father's shoulders.Her chabby face is resting comfortably on her father's head.Her little hands are dragging the collar of her father's flannel overcoat.The father,like his little girls,looks wistful,firmly holding the girls little leg,with his sinecry big hands.Another little irl is in red otted blouse and short-skirt.Her hair looks like a mess of cabbage.Her hands are grasping the cold iron bar;it seems as if she wanted to squeeze her little head through the gate.Prossibly lack of the mother's care,they all look casually dressed,especially ten father---his mudelled hair,his flare trousers creased,his shoes dusty.Describing What People DoI am one of those who are never able to sleep like a log,soI can tell exactly at what time the lights are turned on every morning.The biological clock in my body works so well that by the time the lights are on,that is at six o'clock,I have been turning over on the bed,fully aware the light will be on at any time in the next fifteen minutes.When jthe light turns on,I first try to hide in the shadow of the musquito-net shunning the sudden bright light.But soonI find the white light just keeps peneatrating my eye-lids;I suddenly opened my eyes,face the luminous ray,deeply inhaled the cool air and rise up.Putting aside the warm quilt,I get out of the bed begin to put an the clothes on the chair,whichI have usually prepared the last night.Atabout6:20,dressed,I take cup,tooth-brush,ooth-paste towel and basin to the washing-room.Usually at this moment most girls are still struggling on their beds to get up,soI am always the first one to get there.The process usually begins with the meticulous teeth-brushing because having suffered from some teeth disease,I am very conscious of teeth hygiene.Ten minutes later,going back to any room,I take out some necessary instruments and sterilizing liquid to wash my content-lens.This requires evenmore meticulationI first remove the lid from the sterilized bottle,take out the fragile lenses and put them on my left palm.Then pour several drops of sterilizing liquid on them and use my right forefinger to gently rub the lenses.When they are dried up,I carefully put them into my eyes,as ifI was holding a precious diamond on my finger-tips.During this time,my breakfast,a cup of yogurt sent onto my table;the loud speaker outside is broadcasting the news on central People's Broadcasting station.At6:45,I quickly comb my hair,pick up the necessary materials for the corses on that day and go out for morning reading at7o'clock.The above is just whatI usually do in the morning of Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday.For the nest weekdays when morning exercises is required,that is another story.",6

77,"Euthanasia should be legalized in China Euthanasia means the painless killing of incurably ill or old people.he legalization of it has been a controversial issue in the world.Nowadays,several countries,including Switzerland,Norway and Germany,have adopted the legalization of mercy killing.However,Chinese authorities seems tobe holding vague attitudes toit.In my opinion,euthanasia should be legimated The practice of euthanasia aims at releasing the pain of incurably ill or old people before they die.Death is a physiological phenomenon as well as birth.Mothers give birth tochildren with the help of midwives.Sometimes,people also need assistance when they want todie.Mercy killing is in the case.It propelled the death as the death is inevitably.Since people are born without any mentally or physically pain,why do they die with so much suffering?In this way,mercy killing is humane.It shouldn't be forbidden.Since mercy killing reduces people's agony and shortens the time of death,euthanasia cuts down the medical expenses.In China,the medical bills are paid by the patients themselves and partially by the states.If large amount of money and medical techniques still can't extend people's lives,what the doctors and the relatives do is waste tosome extent.The dying people's relatives are able torelease the economic burden and the state can utilize the funds in other fields.In China,the expense of cancer treatment hits100,000to1,000,000RMB which is not available in an average family.Although it sounds cruel tohasten one's death for the economic reasons,the expense is really a big problem in a unwealthy country.As a developing country,the medical facilities are relatively poorer in China,compared with the developed countries.One obvious problem is that the hospitals lack of beds for the patients.Some have toaccommodate in the ailses of the hospitals.If an incurable patient received euthanasia,a bed could be available for others who might receive treatment in time and extend their lives.Moreover,some diseases can't be cured without the advanced medical equipment.The patients merely lie in bed,suffering painfully with countdown of the approach of death.Euthanasia can solve all these problems.The establishment of legal systems assists in reducing some controversial issues.In the early1950s,Dr.Sanders of Hillsbow Country treated an old woman patient by mercy killing which led him togreat trouble and tortured him for a long time because euthanasia wasn't legalized at that time.Chinese people should learn a lesson from this case so as toimprove the efficiency of the social function and avoid some unnecessary conflicts.However,the legal system of mercy killing should be carefully,coutiously and seriously established so that some criminals will have no opportunities totake advantages of euthanasia.Furthermore,mercy killing should be based on the people's own will and have witnesses,like lawyers,toprove it.In this way,euthanasia can really benefit Chinese people.The advantages of mercy killing can reveal in the fields of humanism,economic benefits and social benefits.I'm sure the legalization of euthanasia will open a new chaper in Chinese people's life.",6
78,"Study Problems Although students have beenstudying all along in their previous time,most of them still meet with some problems in their study.To my view,there are four main problems existing in the study.First,the students lack interests in their study.Sometimes the major courses they chose are not their favourite ones.They chose them,maybe,because of the fashion or the wishes of their parents.Thus,they study inactively and can't learn well.If one can be interested in what he learns,he will be more positive and patient.Second,the students are too shy and coward to ask questions which they have.They think it's a shame to ask the teachers or classmates questions,especially in class and it indicates that they're stupid in front of the classmates.But if the questions or problems can not be solved in time,they will accumulate more and more and the students will have more doubts in their study.Third,some students can't be engrossed in study.They cannot concentrate their minds on the lessens in class which makes them hard to grasp the meaning of what the teachers say.Finally,some students are not painstaking enough.With the hope to take part in the curricular activities,they find thatstudying is very dull and boring.So they give upstudying but to play,which wastes them a lot of time.Of course,there are some other problems except these above mentioned existing in students'studying.In short,students should see and know the problems they meet with in study and then deal with them seriously.Only in this way can they make some progress.",6

148,"3???(c)Legalization of Euthanasia Euthanasia from the Greek means a good death.The argument about the legalization of mercy killing has experienced for a long time in the western countries.Nowadays,this problem extends and lands on China.In my opinions euthanasia should be lowful in China,because it is feasible and its advantages are overwhelming to its disadvantages no matter in terms of the state and hospital,patient's family or individual.In the first place,China's population is approaching to1.3billion.The problem of overpopulation has caused the shortage of medical fund per person.As a result,200patients share one doctor in China while less than80patients share one doctor in the United States.At the same time,statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs26,000yuan a year,thus the medical cost is a heavy burden for the state and hosptals Let us suppose that we donate this amount of money to the Project Hope,lots of students will benefit.Meanwhile,a hopelessly dying patient needs a lot of expensive and rare medecine and facilities to maintain his life.Under the circumstances,it is unavoidable that the conflict between the hopeless patient and the hopeful counterpart appears,owing to he fact that which person should use the only medecine first.Therefore sometimes,lasting a dying person means to deprive a living one of life.Legalizing mercy killing is helpful to solve this problem.For the family members,it is a kind of torture to see their dear relatives dying for a long time with anguish.It is hard to imagine the fact that people watch their relatives to struggle against the pain and they cannot help them.It is harsh to know the truth that your relatives must pass away in several weeks or days.Euthanasia can be a great relief to them both mentally and physically.On the other hand,views on death are changing in China,where a traditional saying is that debt is better than death.New belief is that people should die in peace and harmony.Therefore,most people consider they prefer their relatives to die happily instead of painfully living.In the third place,above all,euthanasia is a kind of mukti for the patient himself.A outsider usually can not feel that the patient grieves to the extent of wishing to die.A survey of200old people shows that92percent do not fear death.They do not want a long waiting period.They want to die with dignity and peace,instead of agony and degradation.Obviously,euthanasia is a progressive way to die because mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that the death will occur naturally and quickly.Dying in several minutes is much better than dying in a week with agony.Meanwhile,people have right to decide in which way they die.People don't have choice to be born,but they have authority to determinate their future.When the doctor""sentences""a patient to death and he losses his living will,waiting death is an unhuman thing.Forcing others to wait for death is the cruelest and most impersonal crime.People should respect others'death choice.In conclusion,euthanasia should be legalized in China,for it is feasible and reasonable.",6

turns of things,you'll waste time instruggling against yourself,and at last,you may forget the most important thing you have to One day I was going to late for school,my mother hurried me:""be quick!Or you'll be late!""I hurried down stairs and found that I forgot to bring the key of my bike,so I hurried up stairs to take my key,this time I found my school bag was left inthe room......when I rode on my bike at last,I was too hurry to break my bike,so youcan guess the final result.Haste Makes makes waste""is an old Chinese saying.If you want to get strong,you eat a lot,you may be sent to the hospital instead of getting Because""haste makes waste"".If you want to get a high score inyour exam,you spand all your time inyour studying,day and night.May this help you success?Perhaps not,Because""haste make waste"".All of us know an old story.A farmer thought his crops grew too slow,he dicide to help them to grow faster.As we know,the result is not so pleasant.Because""haste make waste"".We know that everything has its own regular way,wecan't change it,wecan't be too nervous.should we follow its way,wecan get it.Because""haste makes waste""!Haste Makes everyone has heard ever since primary school days:haste makes waste.What impressed me most is a story,a traditional children's story.There were two brothers who lived on cutting trees inforest The older one was honest and quick-tempered Every morning he got up earlier than his younger brother,and began his work with his tool unpolished.however every time when he went back home with his brother who was always late to work,he was surprised to find that the trees he had cut were less than his brother's.As we know,the reason is very simple:the younger always polished his own tool Some it also applies to our study,some students try to make rapid progress as much as possible.Inthat case,They spend much time inworking;sometimes they forget to eat and sleep.But inthe end,most of them will be depressed that they don't achieve much as expected,but at the cost of their health Hard work is necessary,but we should make good use time as well as set relaxation or entertainment Haste Makes speaking,people usually think when we do something,if wecan do them fast,wecan do well.But the fact is always different.So,we have an old saying""Haste makes waste"".Why do people say""haste makes waste""?for example,you may have not these things.Maybe,you are very hungry,so you go to a restaurant and order some foods.When the soup is ready,you are eager to eat.But,when you try to,you will failed,because it's too hot.It's the same question when we are at work.Becausewhen we want to do it fast,firstly usually we may forget something whichcan make us do it wrong Secondly,quite a lot of things their basical principle Theycan't be done fastly On the contrary,they should be done one by one.The most important aspect is that everything has a process which is often gradual I had a experience just before this examination.I want to cut my pencil,since there is only five minutes,so I cut it fastly,but I failed three You see,Ican't do such an easy thing.From this we alsocan know""haste makes waste"".So,when we want do things better,we must avoidone fault view,fast doesn't means wecan do things well.Haste Makes We all know that famous Chinese saying:""haste makes waste.""The old often use it to advise that young man not to do things so hurry,for the reason the more we wanted to complete the task fast,the more errors would be appeared We are all common people,it is nessecery for us to realize that we'd better make everything steply by steply and also,unease is no use when we have difficulties inour daily life.We need enough time to solve the problem.We perhaps have met something unpleased inour study,failed to pass the exam;can't be the top-class student inour school;lose the chance to compete the scholarship,all the matters seems so bad to But when those coma to you,have you asked youself I make my best:can I do it better?""everyonecannot make all the things like just they want.Never mind,take it easy,we are to continue,time will consider everything we'll save the best for the last.""wecan receive what we want after our hard working,just not so Haste Makes our daily life,we may have experienced enough to recognize the rule makes waste.For example,you are hurry to go to school inorder to do some reading work,but when you sit down you may recall that you had lift the textbook at home.I think if you want to haste your pace,the most importance thing is do prepare work,we must inspect whether everything was ready when we start some work,or wecannot get For example,when you want to learn computer the first thing you do must be how parch the keyboard,you must practice your fingers on the keyboard,then,youcan start to learn the knowledge about how to run a Haste Makes saying""haste makes waste""is known to everyone.It tell us that being hasty and not considering the matters natural law would result inwaste,and it would be a waste of time,energy and money,therefore it would delay the thing we are doing rather than speed up it.There is a proverb inChina""pull the crop to help it grow"",saying a farmer was impatient at the crop,so he went to field day after day to pull the crop a little,then after a few days the crop died,the farmer felt very sorry for the is instructive to us,the farmer ignored the natural law of the crop's growth,only hoped it could grew quickly to have a good harvest,this kind of idea is not acceptable,""haste makes waste"".is true,so,if we hope to be successful,we must have a thoughtful consideration before we act.We mustn't have any imagination.We should depend on the deligence of ourselves to winthe achievements.Haste Makes all of us we hope to do everything as quickly as wecan.Sometimes wecan finish our duty intime.But sometimes wecan't get a good result from the task we have finished,though wecan do this task intime.What have hopped to our behaviour?The only reason is""haste makes waste"".Inorder to do one thing perfectly,at first we should prepare.We should think considerately how we way is indepensible to prepare If we had not enough sensible thoughts,we must have wasted our much of time.For example,I used to want to read fast inEnglish examination.I always tryed to find correct answers through question.On the contrary,the result of test is very poor.BecauseI couldn't gasp the mainidea of one article.I couldn't compenhensive all meanings of phrase and neglect some details of the article.Despite I read more carefully than do quickly.From this case,I belief that""haste makes waste is very reasonable.Inthe future,we might as well do anything by this rule.Haste Makes wants to succeed indoing everything.He tries his best to reach what he will expect.But if he doesn't use right ways he will fail.Long before,I would attend CET-6Exam.I was very worried,for I was poor inthe vocabulary.I made my determine to learn every words by heart.At that time,I just didn't know that it was useless only if I recited the words seperating them from the paragraph.I had thought I found the best and fastest way to learn vocabulary.It could save a lot of time.However the result is beyond my thinking.From then on,I knew a lot.There is no quick way inmany things.Only honest and deligent is the best way.If you want to succeed,do step by step.Haste Makes some people say""haste makes waste""?I think the mainreason is that prepare is not enough.When someone do the job too quickly,he usually hasn't enough time to think it over and prepare for it.Infact,if there is no complete plan for the work there is no good end.For example,someone want to learn English,but he doesn't start with""A,B,C"".he is just interested incomplex sentences and English novels;a runner often dreams to be a race but he expicts everyday's exercise;there are a lot of things and people like mentioned above as you know,the only thing theycan get is the failure.So wherever and wherever we study,we work or we learn.We should remember the phrase,""haste makes waste"".Wecan do from the basic and even if we do it well wecan set our marks higher.Just like the girl who wanted to sell her eggs,don't count the chicken before theycan be hated.Haste Makes person who wants to succeed always tries to save time and his energy.I don't think it's a good idea becausehaste makes waste.Most of us are common people.We have almost the same intelligence and wisdom.If we dream of being successful.We have to do everything step by step.For example,when we are learning English we should learn from A.B.C and master the basic grammar.To learn English is very difficult as well as many other things.And practising is of great importance.We need spending a lot of time.While,some people don't think like this way.They seem to be wiser than the people around them.They scorn at those who are devoting themselves learning English.They try to find out their own quick method.As a result,they never master this beautiful but difficult language.Not only learning English but also everything we are to do requires us a kind of spirit-persisting and enthusiasm.Please rememberhaste makes waste.Haste Makes our society,we often heard this warning:""Haste Makes Waste"",it had been handed down of generations.When our forefathers were inbattlefields used this warning and won at last.Many businessmen were incompetitions used this warning boomed their we should use this warning inour studies and lives,or you will suffer great losses.This is my experience:in1993,when I was a freshman inbook office,my teacher asked me that if I sale one ticket,I must delete one mark incomputer.At first,I followed it.Several weeks later,I thought I could do it quicker.I often sold several tickets,then I deleted those marks at same time.I was glad to do it.But one afternoon,there were too many people to wait.After I sold tickets,I found I couldn't remember how many tickets I sold and,where they are going to.This mean I couldn't delete the marks correctly and my action would led to overlap tickets marks and manger couldn't calculate how many spare seats there are inairplane.When I told my teacher what had happened,she didn't scold me,but she only said:""Haste Makes Waste"".Though my teacher tried her best to deal with this thing and,everything was fine.But I always remember his words inmy life.Haste Makes wants to do things well and quickly.Especially inthe modern society,time is money,so people are haste to do their job ina short time,they may realize it for""effective""but we must to know that""haste makes waste"".When you do things inurgent you have not enough time to think about it,so you will not have a good way to solve any problems you may meet.Inthat case,can you still youcan take it easy.In1958,China has gone through a thoughtless period.At that time,the government work harder and harder so as to exceed the Britainand U.S.A..The worker of steel factories worked through day and night without have had a rest,and the urban citizen or farmers all devoted the iron products to country they wanted to make curious insuch short time.The effect was well-known now,they failed.They couldn't make their dreams come true at all because it has out of the natural regulation.According to the examples above,wecan get some useful ideas.We may do things after comprehensive thought and always remember that""haste makes waste"".Haste Makes is known to all,everything inthe world has its general regulation According to this,we should do everything step by step.It is important to make it from nothing to everything.All needs time,effort,If you want to turn the worst thing into the best one invery short time,youcan't be successful becausehaste makes waste.For example,inlearning English,every student hope to master English language very well,and to read it fast and speak it fluently like others.But we must learn the saying---haste makes waste by heart.We should learn English from the beginning,we should not wish to memorize several hundreds English words a day,ten to twenty words is enough.And wecan listen to the English record about an hour a We must have some time to digest the knowledge we learn.Only by this,wecan master all of it.Otherwise,nothing will become ourselves.Haste makes waste,and do everything step by step We will be successful.Haste Makes one know thathaste makes waste.Becauseeverything is done slowly and is received fillfully wecan success to do it,otherwise wecan fail to do it.Inour study,this words is understanded easily,when the exam is coming,some students beginto study hardly but they doesn't study inother times.they must not pass this exam.If you studied hardly everyday,the technowledge was understanded bit by bit,you would pass the exam.From this example,wecan think thathaste makes waste.Certainly,inlife,inwork and inanyway,we must remember thathaste makes waste.Inshort,when we do everything,we must pass through working hard,wecan do something better,haste makes Haste Makes people think that the more the more achivement They take it for granted that so long as wecan save time as much as possible,we are sure to do more work and gainour aim But is it true?I am sorry to say that it is not always true.Haste makes waste.As we know,if we haste to do some things,it is possible that we will make some mistakes.For example,if you drive your car too fast inorder to get to school earlier than before,you may have an accident,and the result is that you get to school much later than before.If you haste to write,you may write wrong words and you have to correct them,which only wastes your time.Why when we haste to do things,there are so many mistakes?The mainreason is that we do not consider things wholely We usually consider them one side and neglect the other sides.So we must remember the proverb""more haste,less speed.""Haste Makes may hear""haste makes waste"",but why do we say so,I think the real reason is as Firstly,when we do a thing,our aim is to gainsuccess.So we must do our best,including selecting the best means and inthe shortest time but if you only think you should finish the work as soon as possibly you will fail to do some important steps,and the effects are not what you want.Secondly,everything has its own rule,if we debate the rule of the thing,we will be punished,we will not get the wanted effects too.Every one must have heard the story:a farmer wants his crops growing faster,so he pulled the crops off the soil a little,after some time,his crops all died.He debated the growth rule of the crops,and he should be punished certainly.Sometimes we want to make progress instudies,but we are so anxious that we fail.Ina word,we must avoid""haste makes waste"".Haste Makes is known that""Haste makes waste"".But why?The reason is apparent Whatever you do,you must make a good prepare Inthe contrast,if you do something ina hurry,you'll going to catch the early trainon a business trip.But the time is limited,so you are nervous.Ina hurry,catching the suitcase without making sure everything needed is init,you rush out.Arriving at the station,you sadly find out that the ticket is left on the table.Maybe some of us have experienced what's said above and they know better what the proverb means.From the example,wecan see that haste makes us unable to take everything into account.We easily leave something out,so the success is out of touch A good prepare will lead you to the achievement,this is my conclusion.Haste Makes makes waste.Firstly,it will make you become very nervous.Under this condition,it will be very difficult for you to find a good way to solve the problem you facing.Secondly,haste will make you become careless.Youcan not do or think a thing thoughtfully.Thirdly,it will make you lose patience.You will fail to do something which youcan do better.Last year,I attended the college English Test(Band-six).Inmy teacher's opinion,Ican pass it.But during the examination,I was very nervous and hasted to finish all the questions.Even some very easy questions,I failed to answer them correctly.Of course,I lose the examination.whatever you do,youcan't haste.Haste makes waste.Haste Makes all hope that everythingcan be done well as early as itcan.It is a good wish.But we should realize thathaste makes waste.Everything has its laws.We make a dicision and try our best to achieve it,which needs a hard time.Inthe course of it,we should make more preparations.Itcannot haste.As long as everything is done well,the result we wish will be coming.If we always think that we must or have to do it well,and do less,wecannot achieve it.example,we are going to pass a test.We must prepare,and when doing we should do slowly if time is plenty.The more curious we are,the worse we do.So we must realize thathaste makes waste.We do hard and we will succeed.Haste Makes know,all things run themselves ways They have to pass the beginning,developing and going to an end,we must do a thing by some rules.Haste makes waste.We once know such a story:a farmer wanted his corp growing fast,so he sticked out them of the groud,he thought he would helped the corps growing,but the corps all dead.So we conclude,Haste makes waste.When we begina thing,we must prepair lots of it,for example,investigation,analysis,review the text before an exam,and so on,then,we finished the work of prepairing is said that good beginning is1/2success.We should remember:more think then do a thing.Haste Makes is known to all that""haste makes waste"".That's what Chinese always say.It means when you hurry up to do something important,you alwayscan't engage it if you too stress speed.For instant I experienced myself I had an important interview at8:00am one day.But when I got up,it was already7:45.I dressed myself inhome without breakfast.When riding on a bike,I was still very angry on myself,thinking it was how terrible a day.Thinking that,distrating I'm suddenly knocked down by a car.I broke my arm,and then had to be inhospital.That is""haste makes waste.""But it doesn't mean you must do a thing with lots of time.It demands to arrange time properly and does things inturn.All inall,if youcan realize it,youcan avoid it---""haste makes waste"".Haste Makes the proverb says,more haste,more waste.It turns out,if you do something ina hurry,you will ignore some parts These parts may be unimportant,however,they are vital sometimes.So they will lead you to fail Inorder to illustrate""Haste makes waste"",Ican set several examples as follows.When we go to college,we must get through elementory school,school.If you don't finish them and have not enough knowledge,you will face a lot of difficulties.Furthermore,you want to learn swimming,you must do some exercise,and know of some foundamental skills.you not,you may be drown inthe swimming pool.So we should not only stress""haste,but also stress""waste"".a college student,I should work hard during the course of studying.I should not only emphasis""haste"".More work hard more gain.Haste Makes is a preverb inChina that is""haste makes waste""It means that if you want to do something quickly often you will not do it well and will do it much slow.As we all know,if you want do you should make the plan first,then do some preparing,after that wecan do the thing better and more quickly.But if we do something ina haste,wecan not make the plan well,wecan not decide how to do it better.As a result,a lot of time will be delayed and we will not satisfied with what we have done.I have a personnal experience of""haste make waste"".It was a month ago that I bought a ticket to HangZhou.The trainwas8:15am.But at that day,it was already8:00am.when I got up.So I rushed one of the door and run to the station.But when I was entering the station,I found my fare did not inI left it at home!Ican't get inthe train!I went home disappointed,the fare was lying on the table as if it were laughing at me.Haste Makes all know the old Chinese saying""haste makes waste!""this means:you want to do something quickly and successfully,but you didn't want to finish it ina long time and take more efforts to it.At last,you certainly fail to finish it on time.For example,inone morning,you sleep so deeply,that you'll be late,so you get up quickly,and rush to school but unfortunately,you leave your books at home when you reach school you have to go home againto bring them.Finally you are really late for school.If you realize the saying--- ""Haste makes waste"",youcan do all things calmly.And youcan get up promptly but not hurrily thus youcan finish all preparation work intime.So when you get to school,youcan find that you arrive at school on time.All inall,if you understand the meaning of the saying""Haste makes waste"",youcan do something intheir order and finish them ahead the schedule.Haste Makes makes waste.Becauseif you want to get some one point you should be ready for it.Only when the condition is all ready,youcan succeed ingetting the point.The developing of everything needs time.If you want to get it too fast,you will failure We saidhaste makes waste.For example,learning English needs long time.There are so many words you must know.There are so many grammar and idiom you should learn.At the same time you should practise.Writing and speaking English often is nessessary All those things need long time.If you spend short time,you only know few words,some grammar and idiom.Infact,you don't learn English completely.So youcan't get you point that learning English.So we said,haste makes waste.Haste Makes is said that Haste Makes Waste,and we should remember it when we do everything.Improving our speed is useful to us,can save a lot of time to do another work.But if we only require what we do,it is harmful,maybe wecan't get the aim what we do or make mistakes inour works.only will waste our time.Haste Makes Waste are usually happened inour lives.For example,if we'll get good marks inour test,we read the book all the time and don't have a rest.It is no useful to our study;sometimes we want to finish our homework inless time,but when we finish it,we'll find there are many questions done wrong for our careless We have to work it again....All of these proved that Haste Makes Waste,and we should remember it all the time.Haste Makes people always say""Haste makes waste"".It means you would not reach your purpose if you give too much mind to hasten your steps.The words are reasonable.For example,you must finish four articles during a week.Maybe you want to have much more time to play.So you write them at high speed and it takes you one day to finish the articles.As a result the words are not clear,the content is also not good.I think your teach will be not satisfied with you and your writing does't get better.If I were you,I would make a plan firstly Then I would finish it step by step.Ina word,you may not concentrate too much on your speed and ignore the result.It's bad for you.You should do a thing step by step.Remember,Haste makes waste.Haste Makes says""more haste,less speed"".It is of great significance.It means,if you want finish one thing overnight,then,the outcome is not as you has thought,on the contrary,it will lead to a opposite direction,and waste your precious Why?The reason is that youcannot think the thing over,youcannot predict the probable outcome when you are on the spur of the moment.For example,Chinese Big Stride Movement is a typical instance.At that time,Chinese people were very poor,therefore,they want to change this condition ina very short time.So they felled woods,and took out their own household oven,and so on.They used these to produce steels.But people couldn't realize what they thought.Their life is even poorer,moreover,felling excessively caused environmental problem.They wasted their time,their money and their energy,and the like.So,youcan understand this proverb's meaning.And,you should know when you set out to do You must consider it carefully,then do it,finally,you will finish it very well and alsocan save your Haste Makes makes waste"",it show us that we must do anything at ease.Because,if man do a work fast without caution,he would failed,then it causes the waste not only on hands but also on money,and the further result is the work must be done again,it causes the waste of time.is the mainor true mean of""haste makes waste"".There are many examples about""Haste Makes Waste"".For instance,a man who want to learn English,he know nothing about""A,B,C,..."",but he doesn't learn how to prounounce they are and begins to read English text at So whenever he must take an English directionary and hecan never know English truly If the man learn the proununcation at first,he could read the words or the text loudly,whichcan help his memory,so he could maste English quickly by this way Anyone wants to do a work better,he must be paitent does the work with paitent man could succeed to do",5
164,"It is obvious most of persons have their own views.On the one hand,some people go in for doing a kind of job all through their lives.There are someone reasons:some people may go in for the work;some people think it was the only work that they can do best;other people may be afraid of unemployment after they give up the origine work.On the other hand,some people like changing jobs frequently.Most of them want to learn well in every fields Nowdays technology is improving quickly.It calls for people to master it through practicing.Many people are unemployed for the lack of technology.In brief,it is the society that call for people changing their work.In my opinion,we can learn something through changing jobs,so I agree to change jobs.We are fit for more jobs.",5

181,"Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia,or mercy killing,means helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients without any pain by using some medicines.At present,euthanasia is being practised throughout the world and many countries,like Norway and Germany,have established legal systems to deal with it.Several years ago,euthanasia was first advocated in the National People's Congress and people suggested euthanasia should be legalized in China.Actually,after several years of practise in some urban areas of China,people began to see the advantages of euthanasia but,as we know,Chinese attach more importance to the intimacy of family members,so it's quite difficult to implement the practise of euthanasia throughout China,especially in rural areas,unless it is legalized.Euthanasia is the product of human civilization and social development.To most of the people,including doctors and patients,they have an ambiguous idea of euthanasia.Therefore,we should establish legal systems to cope with it less that somebody should misuse it.The legalization of euthanasia in China is based on China's present economic and cultural situations.Its practise is beneficial to indivials and society.China is a developing country with a large population.In most of the rural areas people are living a poor life.They are lock of food and money.If they have money,they would use it to fill up their stomach rather than cure their disease Hence,suppose one of their family members is seriously ill and the doctors say they couldn't save him,and what they can do is to delay his death,then what will they do?Obviously,they can't afford it even though everybody doesn't eat.Then it puts them in dilemma.They think it is inhumane to kill him,but what else can they do?So at this moment,if they know about euthanasia,their problem will be solved,because what they do is legal and they don't have to assume any legal responsibilities.Unlike other western advanced countries,China is lack of developing capital so that its social fare systems are not as perfect as theirs.In those countries,some nursing homes sponsored by the government can provide perfect service to the aged until their death.However,in China,it's impossible and unpractical to do that.We would use our limited money on those who are in need of help.To those who can not be cured,we can think about euthanasia to save our energy and resources to help those who can be saved.At the same time,China is lack of medical personnels and experts,so in order to improve our efficiency,euthanasia should be legalized.Euthanasia can help to reduce the pain of the patient and the relatives.To those who are dying,pain and suffer get the upper hand of their mind and life means suffering.As regards this point we should change our mind about death and know more about euthanasia.As a matter of fact,euthanasia is quite new to Chinese people.We only know its obstensible meaning.As a result,many perverse people can take advantage of it to reach their targets.For example,if one doctor kills his patient by accident,he could claim it's euthanasia.If the family members want to vie with their fathers or mothers for property,they can reach an agreement with the doctor to use euthanasia.Therefore,we should make it clear and explicit to the public through regulations and laws to prevent anybody misusing it.Both hospitals and family members should respect the dying person's opinion.The final decision should be made by three sides and witnessed by a lawyer.Once euthanasia is legalized,it can avoid a lot trouble between the hospital and the family members.On the other hand,it seems Chinese people don't like to solve their problems in a legal way.In most mountainous backward areas,people turn a blind eye to the law,so it is more necessary to make it legalized and let everybody know it.Since China concentrates on its economic construction,it should at the same renew people's idea towards death.Euthanasia is now practised and adopted by many countries and we can see its advantages,so we should build lagal regulations to handle it and make it explicit to the public.",6

217,"ST?Dear sir.I have been your downstairs neighbour for nearly one year.I am quite heartened to have a hard-working and easy-going neighbour like you.However,in recent mouths,I have been suffering a great deal of noise coming from your apartment which makes me quite upset and to write you this letter.For the past two months,almost every afternoon,I found it hard to fan asleep while your recorder kept playing certain music.Although most of the songs were my favourites as well,I did find they wore not played at a right time,for I think the eriod of time between1:00p.m and2:30p.m should be the time f st.I am not criticizing your schedule here,but I do need uiet as your neighbour.Yesterday,you kept playing the Rock roll songs in a loudly voice throughout the afternoon and I was orced to go out for a walk instead of sleeping.I used to have the habit of going to bed early at night.But I am now changing it for your sake.Every night you return rather late and make a lot of noise which awakes me quite often.Last Saturday night I was awaken to find it was three o'clock in the morning.Again I am not blaming you for your habit,but I would be most grateful if you could make your steps softer and your movement less noisy on return.It always took me half an hour to wait for the end of the noise of the bumps of door and chairs etc.Your final two heavy bumps of throwing your leather shoes sometimes almost frightened my heart to jump out.Living in the same building,I think we have got to establish a good relationship between us,which simply means our mutual respect to each other.I hope you will share my opinion and allow me a quiet and easy life.With my best regards.Yours faithfully Zhang Long Parties I Have Been To Three kinds of parties have presented me with various feelings:festival party,birthday party and farewell party.They have brought to me happiness.Embarrassment and even sadness.Festival party is the kind that I enjoyed most.For I did feel happy in attending it.Festival party is for everybody and ll the attendance have the chance to participate the activities rather than just sit and watch.While celebrating the festival n forms of singing.Dancing and cheers.We could all sense the gay atmosphere then and wore delighted that colorful new days were coming soon.I met lots of acquaintances in the parties,who were equally cheerful as I was.When talking about the impression,we all agreed that the party was great.Birthday party sometimes made me feel bored and embarrassed,for I was sometimes invited to a stranger's birthday party.Not knowing how to formulate my best wishes,I sat there in silence,ith a forced smile on the face,This always made people feel that I was uncommunicative and I often failed to give any xplanation to redeem my image.Even when attendinga friend's birthday party I still felt uncomfortable.Since I considered myself a closefriendof the host,I used to act like a bee,often talking many irrelevant nonsense,doing many unnecessary things.I used to attract so much attention that the host,who had expected to be the key man in the party,became unhappy with me.And it has always been too late for me to realize that I had made myself ridiculous.Farewell party is the kind of party bringing me unspeakable sadness.The atmosphere of it had been expected to be joyful.But we always failed to restrain our reluctant feeling to part and the party used to end up in a sad atmosphere,with everybody in tears or in a bad mood.There will certaintly be more parties ahead for me to ttend.I will also be supposed to behave properly.I wish there would e some new kinds of parties different from those I have tended nd I could feel happier and comfortable in them.Two Different Schools Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages(GUFL)and Linan University are surely of two different types as far as their environment.Academic atmosphere and entertainment activities etc are concerned.Locating at the foot of Baiyun Mountain,GUFL enjoys a autiful and tasteful environment,Which allows its people to work and study in a peaceful way.One can be free of the noise and excitement downtown,breatheing the pure and fresh air here and taking a rest on the meadows or in the shadows of the trees.As to INU.Which lies nearly at the center of the city,the noise and the polluted air from the busy traffic nearby and the several large markets and shops surrounding it does make people on the campus suffer a lot.Moreover,the four main gates of INU are usually open to the outside world,which makes people outside always go in for a sightseeing or merely for a rest.So the school is now becoming more and more like a public park.The academic atmosphere in INU seems to be more active than that in GUFL.Various kinds of lectures,discussions or debates are held in INU almost every week,focusing on international trade and finance issues stock market problems and social phenomena etc.Students take active part in these ctivities and bring their talents and knowledge from textbooks into full play.However.People in GUFL seem to be indifferent in such activities which will actually benefit them a lot.Occasionally you can have a public lecture or sth else,but most students are not very interested in it and the attendants are always less active.GUFL is proud of its colorful entertainment activities which include singing contest.Dancing performance and poem reciting etc.Every season we have various activities to add colors to our life.All these activities are organized by the school and are all successful.In INU the situation is a bit different.Owing to its large scale,every department is responsible for its own mattes.So you can only find some small scale entertainment activities held by each department.They thus don't cause any sensation.There are only few activities which are organized by the school and can round off.CUFL and INU may have many things in common as an university.But they really differ in the above aspects.How to learn the CECL Course The full name of CECL is Communicative English for Chinese Learners.It is a course for English majors and is taken as a practice in GUFL.This course emphasizes more on training the student's ability of listening comprehension and spoken English and it also includes certain amount of exercises for writing and reading.The whole textbook is divided into about forty units,each dealing with a topic of life,culture,history,geography science,medicine and etc.In using this textbook,students will be instructed to do the reading.Listening writing and speaking practice.All these exercises are concerned about the topic of the unit.For example if the unit is about Cuisine.You will need to read several passages about,say,the various styles of cuisine,the making of certain Chinese dishes,the proper wrong of using western table wares etc.Having gone through the passages,students will be instructed to some do exercises,say,writing down some points of the idea embodies in the passages.For the listening comprehension exercises,students will be required to listen to a dialogue or something else about how the foreigners feel about Chinese food or the process of cooking a Chinese dish etc.Students will then need to grasp the main ideas and write them down or to use the information they have heard to fill in blanks or charts.The most active step in learning this course is the oral practice.Students will be encouraged to discuss certain topics about the unit between them,Sometimes with the help and organization of the teacher,the students will have an animated debate.Through these oral practice,the students will be able to not only practise their spoken English,but also express their own ideas upon the topic.Having finished the unit,the students will usually be asked to write an essay or composition about the topic they have dealt with,writing down their feelings or impressions.Before the teaching of each unit,students will be given a word list of the new words and phrases to help them.A pair of earphones is also provided for each student for their listening exercises.CECL does have many advantages in training students'comprehensive ability.It helps to broaden the students'knowledge as well.However,a lot of improvements are still needed to make it bettor serve the purpose of teaching English majors Friend The dictionary has varied explanations for the word""friend""ranging from""person one knows and likes""to""helper to""supporter""No matter how different people view""a friend""as surely there is one thing in common,afriendshould be a person who is familiar with you and you two do enjoy a relationship.When you are lonely and depressed,you may needafriendto be with you,for you need someone who is patient enough to listen to you and to propitiate your sorrow or anger.Afriendis a person who knows you well and is inclined to share your misfortune when you are in trouble.The friendship may make you believe that at least there are your friends in the world who will care about you and you may talk to for help.Sometimes you may merely feel like to talk to someone to have our happiness shared by more people.Again you need your friends to be with you.You may have a good time together and this hilarity will surely drive away your loneliness.Some people may think thatafriendis a person who can give help and support.But I would like to claim thatafriendis a person whom you need not to wear disguise before.You may tell him or her your secret and he or she will keep it for you.When you suffer frustration in job,life and love etc.You may go to find your relief and pleasure in friendship.For your friends will assure you that they will always stand by you and be ready to help.Afriendis a person whom you may go for help without the least hesitation and ceremony.A friends is a person who will do all the needed things for you without being asked for or paid for.I can not imagine what my life will be if I fail to find anyfriendbut only emimies and hypocrites.My frends are part of my life.",6

234,"After conducting a thorough cross-examination,please allow me to have a conclusive statement as defense lawyer.Firstly,this knife is a pretty strong piece of evidence.The boy admits buying a knife like this in his neighbourhood after being bit by his father.You may doubt whether this unusual knife is a present for a friend as the slum boy says?But I easily got it in a little junk shop around the corner from the boy's house.Since there's no fingerprint on it,it can't prove that this is the exact knife the boy uses to stab his father.Sencondly,the testimony of the old man is not so persuable.As we know from our common sense,you can't hear yourself think because of the awful noise when your window is open and the train goes by.So it's impossible for the old man to have heard the boy say""I'm going to kill you""while the front of the EL war roaring past his nose.Another important point is time.The old man was positive that he got to his front door from his bed in15seconds.The hall of his house is43feet,six inches long.He had to get out of bed,get his canes,walked twelve feet,open the bedroom door,walk forty-three feet,and open the front door to see what was happening.Could anyone of you believe that it's possible for an old man who walks with2canes can do all in15I think the old man was trying to get to the front door.He heard someone running down the stairs and assumed it was the boy.He didn't witness it by his eye.Let's go over the women's statement.The murder was taking place as she looked out of the window while tossing and turning in bed.She couldn't have time to put on her glasses in a second to see clearly who was the murderer.To sum up,there are many contradictions in the evidence and the testimony.I don't think a wise verdict should be result from these groundless evidence.Every bright juriors I'm sure you'll vote impatially without any prejudice of the innocent boy from the slum.We believe that law is fair and nobody innocent will be verdicted to be criminal.",6

stealthily,and afriend of mine,who is good at stealing,will visit your room frequently.Cities I have Visited Cities I have visited can generally be divided intotwo types,modern and traditional.Guangzhou,is one of the most modern city in China.There,skyscrapers can been seen everywhere.All kinds of motocars fill the wideroad.Railway,express way,overhead highway,ocean liner and airlines make the transportation very convenient and efficient.Citizens there arerich than the inlanders and their ideais also modern and open.Shaoxing,amedium sided city in Zhejiang province,is atypical tranditional Chinese city.It has no skyscaper no overhead high way,not tomention expressway,the most speedy transportation railway is constanted by japanes before liberation.Tile-roofed buildings and sampans compose the feature of the city.Citizens there arenot so open-sighted and mammonistic as in the southern cities.Many of them and still keeping there long-lasted life style inherited from their ancestors.In fast,the distinction between modern cities and traditional cities is becoming more and more vague.Modern culture and traditional culture exist simultaneously in many cities.But all those cities have the same develop trend,they are becoming more and more modern.Two Schools By far I have only studied in three schools:aprimary school,amiddle school and auniversity.The latter two give me great impression,so now I will talk about these two schools Dan Middle school and GDFL.Dan Middle school is afamous school in my hometown,it has1,200students,desided into24classes,each class has almost50students.It lies at the foot of amountain called Dan mountain,there aretrees and flowers on campus,some of them are very precious.There is even aorchard behind the school building,with loquat,purple,arrange and some other fruit trees in it,all many greedy students.Compared with Dan Middle school,GUFL is much bigger and famous.It has more students and teachers,more classes,but each class has only20---30students.It also lies at the foot of amountain,it also has many trees and flowers on campus,but you can't find asingle fruit tree there.Neverthless you can satisfy you stomach in canteens,food stalls and restaurants,you can easily find them.Since GUFL is aforeign languages university,students and teachers come from every part of the world,you can hear alot of languages and dialects spoken there,while in Dan Middle school,you can only hear home's dialect,and English.The disciplines in GUFL is much looser than in Dan Middle school,there you can smoke,can drink,can talk freely,can have love affairs.Students have much free and colorful lives.CECL is acourse of English forChinese learners,it has its distinction compared with other language courses.First of all,CECL pays high attention on listening and oral skills.There are many listening and oral skills.There are many listening and oral exercises in this course.So tohave this course,each student prepares their own earphone,the teacher plays the CECL tape through arecorder,students listen toit and do the exercises on the book.Then the teacher checks students'answer.If necessary,the tape will be played again.As tooral exercises,the teacher usually devides the class intoseveral groups,each was2or4students,then the teacher set the students talk about the topics in English,the teacher listens tosome of them and sometimes takes part in acertain group talking.If thetopicis controversial,the teacher will allow students again.Reading and writing also compose avery important part of CECL.There are many reading meterials CECL books,after students read them,they will be asked todo exercises,such asanswering questions,do alternative choice commenting,Sometimes the teacher will ask the students towrite aessay on thetopicin orout side class.In CECL,materials forstudying is not limited inside CECL,the teacher often offer other English materials tothe students,such as English newspapers,magazines,foreign movies and English radio programme,etc.That's the distinction of CECL.Masculinity is the quality orstate of having the qualities suitable foraman.It contains two aspects external masculinity and internal masculinity.External masculinity is observable from appearance.People usually define external masculinity as follows:tall and bright eyes,walks like agale and stands like apine.So within that defination those who have pooreye sights,short orthin bodies,milky skins should be absolutely ruled at from the troops of nowadays people consider internal masculinity more than external masculinity,especially those who have been ruled out from external mascular They define real as that,aman with strong will and great endurance,he has his own ideal and struggle hard continuously forit,he will not weep when failed,never bend before others ordifficulties,he may be thin and feeble in body,but his spirit is made of iron and steel.That is the internal masculinity,is it more difficult toachieve than external masculinity!It was4o'clock now,I reckoned uncle Wang should be at home at this time,so I picket up the phone and dialed his home.""Hello,""aclear voice emerged.I knew it was uncle Wang's elder daughter.""Hello,this is Zhang Qing.I want tospeak touncle Wang,is he there? ""Yes,wait aminute,please.""After afew seconds.The phone was picked again at the other end.""Hello,is that Zhang Qing?"" ""Yes,uncle Wang.I have something totell you.""Ianswered hesitatingly.""Say it please.""

""Er You know,I am ateacher,a""One of the robbers heard the last word,without awaiting the whole sentence""aretired one.""He declared like atrump with despair,""Take care of your worn bag,old gentleman,I don't rob you.Teachers are still too poortobe robbed nowadays!Boys,go!""He waved his arm toother robbers and came at the rest passengers.Therefore,in the whole section,all the passengers were left few things except my old relative.When others""congratulated""him,his feeling coupled luck and sadness.Dear Mr.and Mrs.A,I'm now writing tocomplain about the noises coming down from your house.In general,being anew neighborof you I feel quite all right but forthe noises.Almost every early morning since you came tolive upstairs,Mrs.A sang from5:30to6:30.I form ahabit of getting up late because I study till11:30at night.Mrs.A is agood singer but her voice is too loud,when she sings just afew meters above I've tried earphones and I try togo on sleeping but it doesn't work.Now I get up at5:30am,and do morning reading with sleepy head and body.I know that you,Mr.A and Mrs.A,like pork very much.From1:45pmto2:00pm,3days per week,I hear the noises of chopping pork Mrs.A bought in the morning.Atthat time,unfortunately I am preparing my lessons in the afternoon.I can't concentrate my attention in reading with sounds made my the chopping block and chopping knife.Forthese2weeks,you have Dance Competition toprepare.I'd like tosee your dance but I will appreciate if you turn the radio abit down.Besides that,would you not dance at other time but not from9:30pmto11:30pm?The steps are too heavy tostop the thrilling of my ceiling.As you know,the walls and ceiling are insulated badly.Last night,I saw something falling down from the ceiling,not dust.I have abit worried about my safety and that of the house.By the way,I have avery very important exam next week and I am now busy in reviewing.Therefore I am not able toenjoy the dance and jazz music.Would Mr.A and Mrs.A have alittle mercy on me?I look forward tohearing from you soon.Three games I've been playing are good forhealth,both in body and in mind.First of all,the game in summer is what I love most.And I love swimming.Summer seems abit long here,including a2-monthes summer holiday.The weather is so hot that I nearly want tocool myself in the pool all day long.In order tokeep fit and aclear mind in study in spite of the boiling temperature,I have totake the swimming pool as the best place.Secondly,I like toplay badminton in autumn.Atthe end of December,I usually have toprepare forexams,therefore,I have less time in playing.I often keep myself at home,as hard-working as abeaver.Mother sometimes drive me out of my""self-made prison""torest.Then I ask friends tothe badminton play-ground,enjoying autumn sun and autumn breeze.Mytireness dies away soon after the game.Finally,chess is played in spring and winter.Spring is ranny season till we greet summer.That indicates less time foroutdoorgames tome.While winter is too cold tohave sweat all-over my back and face.That's the reason that invite friends toplay chess in winter holiday and in spring from time totime.Though chess seems torob my brain some energy,it gives me rest as the badminton does.Since most of the time find failure in chess,I do not like toas much as I like make my life fill with laughter,friendship and health.They will accompany me in all my life.I have been totwo different restaurants which have difference various in environments,inner-restaurant settings,guests and waiters orwaitresses.But they all bring me comfortable feelings.Restaurant A lies in the suburb and it is small in size.While Restaurant B is in the center of the city and it is large.Restaurant B is designed in the middle of apark.Restaurant A is somewhat like aclassical restaurant.Oil paintings decorate the white wall,together with four soft lights pink.In contrast toA,B is simple.It has greenish walls,with four big windows without glass.Fromthe windows,you can look directly intothe park around you.Children playing,laughing,and jumping make it abit noisy.However,A is obviously more peaceful.Restaurant A is near several houses,therefore,they always come there toenjoy dinners together.Usually half foreigners and half Chinese have dinner there.But it's no so with Restaurant B.Almost all the customers are Chinese.Some kind of convinence it brings is that whoever comes there can enjoy the food and the scenery.Restaurant A has five waiters orwaitresses behind the counter and so the customers buy their food and sit down toenjoy it.Nevertheless,B has ten waitresses hurrying here and there,taking plates of dishes.Customers should first select courses from the menu and sit down towait forthem,drinking tea.After dinner,the waitress will come and you have your bill paid.Forthe previous whole two years,I had learned CECL-----Communicative English forChinese Learners.This course is divided intoeight text-books.And each kind of text-book is composed of teacher's text-book and student's text-book which we have in hand.Therefore in general,there are16books of CECL.The content is obviously large-scale.Let's take the unit""Environment""as an example.A hard-working student will first have athorough survey of the lists of new words orphrases.Sometimes,the kind-hearted teacher gives them tous.It's not an easy work forme toprepare the hundreds of words useful in one unit.Forthe whole weeks of learning this unit,I found myself big-headed and heave-hearted,but still confidential tocatch1/4of the new words intomy mind temporarily.The first2classes were tiresome.There were three tasks forus todo.First we had intensive reading.That's,we tried tofind theanswers from an article about3thousands words.It wasacomment onEnvironmentPollution.We all were busy in looking through the article and at the some time finding theanswers.Afteranswering toquestions,we did the vocabulary exercises.We had tolook through the article again.The words were immense-scale,I think of owning four eyes ormore.It happened that the second task was in the second class.We had the listening.It wasalong long article.Two persons were discussing the prevention of pollution.After it,the gap fillings and questions were waiting forus.We should finish them according tothe tape after listening forone time.All the words should be done with ahighly concentrated head.The rest time was todiscuss the issue in the previous article about pollution.The teacher asked us togive our own opinions on the final paragraph,where the authorgave his own opinion.Some discussed it with their partners without problems.Some discussed another""topic""excitedly.Atthe moment,some of us were sleepy.Therefore,we kept talking,talking and talking,and kept our eyes open,open and open.Then,some pairs would receive the respectful inspiration of the teacher.Others brought out their long long breath.The pair tried tohide their voices and,of course,tried togive avery briefanswer----no more than3sentences,15words.Finally,we hoped forthe mercy bell.Some students might not agree with me,forthey owned the teacher's book which contains all theanswers in the student's book.BoredomIn my opinion,boredom has three meanings.One of them in the dictionary is:A sense of being tired and uninterested by being dull ortendious.To illustrate it I am togive you example.Once I came tovisit afriend who newly worked in akindergarten.It happened that she was telling astory full of feelings tothe small ones.I over-heard one child near the doorsaid,""We hear the story9times.""The other one correctedhim,""10times,I bet.""And two of them gave along breath.Atfirst,the children showed calmness and patience.Four sentences later,they couldn't sit any longer and they seemed uneasy.The poorteacher didn't notice it and went on and on.In the middle of the story-telling,achild ortwo seemed that they wanted very much tointerrupt my friend.I knew they could not,forthey were thought it was impolite todo so.Some of them even had their frowned their eyebrows.Then they talked toeach other in low voices.Then in louder voices.Later,my poorfriends noticed the noisy class and realized that it was an oldest story.When aperson can't find anything todo,it is boredom who visitshim.Sunday morning,when I was awake,no one is found in the room.I felt lonely and it turned out tobe boring.I washed my face and brushed my teeth slowly,like asnail.Then I tried tofind something toeat but only got half abowl of cookies.I gorged on them.Then I should read something and discovered that I should first listened tothe music.And so I turned on radio,walk-man and TV.I was absent-minded throughout the whole morning.I sang""Country-road'sometime and danced forawhile.Later I drank acup of teaand aglass of milk and abowl of fruit juice.Finally at12:00pm.I slept.Boredom is abad thing like the words said by Bertrand Russell.""Boredom is avital problem forthe moralist since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by fear of it.""But it is something that none of us can resist.One thing happened when I was a4-year-old girl which is impressed deep in my mind.At6:00pmon one summer day in the country-side,I came home from the kinder-garden.Twelve minutes'walk made me so thirsty that I rush tothe small store not far away from my house.A gentle-lady who was no more than60greeted me.""Lovely girl,what can I do foryou?""she smiled tome.""Would you please sell me the biggest ice stick""I replied quickly and politely,wiping my wet face.Then the old lady kindly asked me whether I took money ornot.I said confidentially,""Yes,I have many money.You see.""I reached intomy pocket and hurried out abig coin which was marked""5cent.""Atthat time I didn't know even the cheapest ice stick cost10cent.I merely found out that the price in the counter was marked0.1yuan.It seems that5was much more than1yuan.I caustiously put the coin on the counter which was nearly as high as me.""Oh""the granny whispered,staring at the coin.It made no sense tome and I was dying of thirst I anxiously looked at the granny.She first took aglimpse at me and smiled.She hurried out abig wooden box covered with2towels.I looked at the crystal-like precious ice stick handed tome.""The biggest one foryou.Eat as quick as you can.It milt easily.""She softly told me.I reached out hands and accepted it eagerly.""Thank you""I wanted togo.""Wait,wait,child.Here's your change.""The granny called me back.My""Change'----1cent.I happily took the shinning coin and with are more thanks toher,came home,enjoying the ice.I caught sine words behind.""only foralittle lovely and thirsty girl..""",6

them throughout the terms.Almost of the classesI have attended are very useful.I am very interested in these classesandpay great attention to them.I come to these classes5minutes before the class beginandeave them10minutes after the classes are over,asking questions to the teachers.During the classes,I take down every word of the teacher.I have my eyes on the teachers throughout the classes.I have never missed any homework of these classes.In these classes,I learn how to write an English address for my neighbour,I learn how to talk with a foreigner on the train.The rest of the classesI have attended are completely useless.I have never been in time for these classes.More often than not,I leave these classes15minutes before the teachers leave.During these classes,I either play my""game boy"",or make plans for inviting my girlfriend,Mimy,to Kara OK.I neither listen to the teachers nor take notes.I even do not known the teachers'names when the school year comes to an end.Actually,I got nothing from these classes.These are the classesI have attended,I hope all the classesI attend will be useful in the future.Shi Zui XianandYun Bei Beside the north gate of GIFL,there are two Da-pai-dangs,One is called Shi Zui Xian,the other is called Yun Bei.I often go to ShiZui Xian for dinner,but seldom go to Yun Bei because the enviroment of Shi Xui Xian is much better than that of Yun Bei.Behind ShiZuiXian,there are green fields while make people feel comfortable,while behind YuBei,there is a stinking ditch which makes on lose appetite at once.The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are well ventilatedandvery bright,while those of Yun Bei are not.The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are also more spacious than those of Yun Bei.It is very quiet in Shi Zhi Xian,neverthelessIt is very noisy in Yun Bei.As She xui Xian is much farther to the highway than Yun Bei,the air in shixui Xian is much cleannerandclearer than that of Yun Bei.So,I really think that Shi Zui Xian is a much better place for dinner than Yun Bei.CECL is a now approach developed by GIFL for Chinese learners of English to develop their communication ability.This class usually consists of listening,reading,talking,writing activities,So you need to get your textbook,vacaburary list,earphone,penandof course,your partner ready before attending your class.First of all,you should preview the vocaburary list because there's no time for you to learn the new words in class.The class usually begins by doing some listening activitis.This time you just listen to the tape played by the teacheranddo the exercises in the book..After that,you should be prepared to answer the teacher's questions.Then omes the reading activity,which is usually some fast-reading materials,Again,year will have to do a lot of exercises,such as summary of a text,gap-filling,comprehensive questions.What follows reading is usually the writing task,you are often required to write a short paragraph or something else,The most interesting thing of the class is the talking activity,in which the class usually ends.In this activity,you should form either in pairs,or in groups,The topics are usually given in the book.Sometimes you have debates besides discussions with your classmates.Quite often you will finish your class in great exhaustionandof course,you will learn a lot in this class.Boredom Boredom is the feeling that one has when he has too much to do or has nothing to do.When a person has too much of something,he will certainly have the feeling of boredom,no matter how interesting the thing he first feel is,when there is othing for one to do,this same feeling will certainly come up.For a student,this feeling appears always when the hurrying the homework;for a husband,this feeling appears always when his wife prepares the same dish for him,or wears the same pajamas,for a lover,maybe when he or she always receives flowers from the same person.Actually,No one in this world that doesn't have boredom.Everyone is complaining about boredomandtrying to get rid of it.However every day everyone is creating new boredom if he his succeeded to abandon the old-which is not often the case.Boredom results from all kinds of things,from doing homework,from travelling on business,from greeting to people,or even from drinking beer--which is longed for by most of people.Boredom is something of great varities,which no ne an escape from.I waitedandwaited at the busstop for a No10Bus.""Excuse me.""Suddly a voice came from behind.I looked backandfound a man of Middle age looking

259,"?a""2Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia,a word form the Greek,means""a good death"",which has another name of""mercy killing""in English.Although it's a medical terminology,euthanasia has arisen a world-wide discussion whether it is legal or not.Some states of the U.S,some countries in Europe and some other places in the world have made laws that permit euthanasia.However,there has been no laws in China on this issue,which has caused troubles for courts.I will argue that euthanasia should be legalized in China in my essay on the basis of human rights,legal system and its goodness to all,including the patient,his/her family and this country.It's a respect to the patient's human right to allow him to die in the legal way of euthanasia in a suitable time.Suppose that now I were a very old man lying on the bed in a hospital.I have had a lung cancer for decades and suffered too much.My life would end in an indefinite period and no doctor but God can help me release my pain.At this time,I have only one hope in my mind that I'd better die painlessly at once.But because I'm in China,there is no law to allow me to do so or to allow the doctor to end my suffering so that I would continue the process of waiting for death.The cases of euthanasia happened in the U.S shows that the mercy killing under the requirement of the patients and it's a respect to their individual rights.""Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane,said Cai Wenmei,an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University.""Every one in our country has the right to choose his/her life style and the laws are established to protect our rights.Thus,if we couldn't suffer the pain any longer and have no hope to turn around,we should have the right to end our life in the way of""mercy killing.""The key point the discussion on euthanasia is whether it's legal or not.Some people said it's a murder to kill those who cannot move,but I'll argue that it's legal.Murder meansthe crime of killing a person intentionally.The crime of murder in law consists of three parts:the criminals motivation,the criminal's behaviour and the harm of this crime.The doctor,or the killer of the patient who requires to end his own life in a painless way has no motivation to kill a person who will die soon because he has no hatred towards the patient and even several days before he had made all his efforts to save the patient's life.So do the patient's family members who agree to take this action.The doctor,or the killer,really take a killing action,but it's not illegal because he has no motivation and the result of his killing is not harmful,which I will illustrate later.The doctor,or the killer help the patient end his painful life under his requirement.Should this killing be called harmful to the patient?The answer to this question is obvious""No"".The three contexts of the murder of euthanasia cannot stand on their feet,so euthanasia is legal and the law of euthanasia should be established to permit those patients who suffer too much and have ho hope to live a happy life to end their life painlessly.Then we should discuss what goodness euthanasia will bring to us.First it's good for the patient.""a survey of200old people shows that92percent do not fear death.They don't want a long waiting period.They want to die with dignity and peace,instead of agony and degradation.""Secondly euthanasia,""the progressive way to die"",can reduce the cost of the patient's family an release their pain.Cai Wenmei said that euthanasia is""a great relief to their family members,both mentally and physically"".Thirdly,it also can reduce the cost of our country.China practices the free medical service so that it spends a large sum of money to save those who cannot be saved every year.If we practice euthanasia according to the patient's will,we can spend the money to save those who can be saved and to cure those who have no money.It's time for China to establish a law to permit euthanasia.Of course,we will confront with the bias from all sides of the society in this process,but if we make clear the goodness of euthanasia to the whole country,we can make progess on this point.I hope that I can die in the way of euthanasia when I become very old and suffer too much from some illness.I believe that my hope will become true and soon or later euthanasia will be legalized in China.",6

322,"""?""a Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia,or mercy killing is to end one's anguished life at it's request.This issue has been the global concern over these years.With the number of old people increasing and the economy developing,euthanasia becomes more and more the problem Chinese government should solve.After viewing either from an individual angle,and the social angle or from scientific feasibility and people's conception,we came to the conclusion that Euthanasia should be legalized in China.Firstly,to an individual,euthanasia is rather a mercy than a murder.If a person is in a bad health situation,it will be suffering.He has to experience all the pain diseases cause and can do nothing.It is quite passimistic because the only thing to do is to wait to die.Life at that time becomes meaningless.Why can't they have the right to die to end the suffering process.Since it's not a happy experience,hastening it can be a good thing.The longer this period is,the more the person will suffer.Secondly,from the social angle,this kind of patients have been a heavy burden for the family and the society.Besides the great deal of money spent on him,family members will suffer mental anguish.The family members are so conscious that they see all the pain their beloved experienced.Furthermore,they can do nothing to help him.It's beyond their ability.How pityful thing it is Chinese have the tradition of serving the olds,they will spend all the thing they own but all these things they spend brings about the loan rather than the patient's happiness.At the meantime,it's a heavy burden for the society.The patients occupy the beds in hospital and need social workers.They are the ones who only get things from the society.It is cruel to say that,yet it is the fact.In addition,the number of old people are quite large,this aspect can not be ignored.Besides these,people's conception has to be considered.China has a long many conceptions have rooted in people's mind.If we pay no attention to this aspect,the legalization will not be a success.Both birth and death are natural events,but people's attitude towards them are vastly different.People usually have a warm welcome to the birth,while try their best to avoid death.There is an old saying in China:debt is better than death.Fortunately,this kinds of views have changed in China.People now put more emphasis on the quality of life than the merely quantity.A comparable short,happy life is accepted by many people.Most of old people don't have the fear for death as they did before.Many people want to die with dignity and peace.They don't want to experience a long waiting period before the death.Instead of the passimistic waiting,they prefer to the progressive way to die.Lastly,let see the feasibility of it.The social development has enable China to pratice euthanasia.There is no scientific problems in it.Modern medicine science can use various methods to maintain the painless of the death.China also has pratised in some area.Apart from all these elements,some people argued that the legalized euthanasia may invite abuse.The unscrupulous persons will take advantage of it and dubbed the murder as""mercy killing"".We have to agree that this is the aspect we should pay attention to In this case,a good law should be introduced to protect the legal euthanasia.We should ensure that the mercy killing is performed at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.The doctors should have joint approval of all medical personnel attending so that to ensure the patient is really beyond hope.We can even set up the institutions to supervise the practice.At the same time,the education on death should be carried out.Euthanasia should be legalized in China.It has been considered in various levels,from different angles.It will be a good news all the Chinese.We can not refuse eating because of choking,all the thing we need to do is to reduce the bad effects as well as possible.Thus people and society will get much more benefits than bad effects.",6

year's in her hometown.Lifang was attracted by his sweat words and trusted him.She followed the young man to come to Guangzhou one month past,the young man did not find a job for her.Li fang began to feel anxious because she almost ran out of her money.She asked the young man when she could work..The young man told her that he had found a secretary job.The paid would be one thousand yuan per month,and she could also have a room which was given by the boss.He took Li fang to the room and asked her to wait for her boss there for interview.Lifang did as the young man said.She stayed in the room alone after the young man left.The room had nothing except a bed and a chair.After a while,someone opened the door with a key.A sixty year old man entered into the room.He closed the door and locked it.He looked sinister with his belly stuck out.When he saw Lifang,he sprang on her liked wolf.Lifary was frightened and struggled hard to get free.The old guy told her coldly that he had paid the young man30,000yuan for buying her.If she did not obey him,she had to pay back to him.So that,all her happiness was ruined poorly.After I leant that,the idea which was to be a secretary in the future was given up.Athough not all are the same case,I know I have to choose my job carefully.Mrs Landlord:I am sorry to bother you,but I can not stand the noise come from the upstair,since they moved in,I never have a good time.If the noisy continue.I think I can do nothing except breaking the contract with you and move out immediately.I was told there are three girls living together above me.I don't understand why they make noise all the time.It seems they never get tired.In the morning,when the sky still is dark,they begin to do morning exercise.In the room,running,jumping and even singing.Sounds very disgusting.I'm afraid that them floor will fall down look at the clock,my godness,It a only five.I can not sleep any more.So drinking coffee in the morning has become my hobby.In order to make me awake.In the evening,I usually do my homework till10.Every time,when I am thinking about something,I always be disturbed by sharp shouting,chatting or laughing.And they the voice of the TV set can be heard a mile away.So I can not concentrate my mind on study,I just go to bed,But when I lay down on the bed,them mini concert begin I can hear a few boys join their party.After I heard the Rock and Roll's music,I lost my appetite.I usually say to myself,Please allow me to have a good night.Read10,000volumes and travel10,000li.I have travel two places,Xian and Hangzhou.I think I prefer scenic spots to ncient relics.Last summer vocation.I went to Xian with some friends for travel.I was told that xian a an ancient city and has many historical monuments.We traveled the tomb of the Chinese Emperor and thousands of life.Size terra-cotta figures.When I steped into there,I felt uncomfortable,every where is so serious,everyone's pace looked so sad.I could say nothing beautiful there,only saw many clay figures,everywhere is so solemn.Though the guild explain to us so patiently.I could not enjoy it.Another thing I disliked is that we could not take photo there.I didn't understand why,that is one of them rules.The guide explained that the excavation of the underground vault of earth revealed thousands of terra-cotta warriors and their horses in battle fomation,and the whole army would follow its emperor into immortality.I am not interested in ancient history,so I felt very dull and went out alone before they finished the visit.After the travel of xian.We went to Hangzhou.Hangzhou has many senic spots.Such as Monastery of the Spirits'Retreal,Pagoda of six Hammories and West Lake.Hangzhou is famous for its west Lake,it has such places of interest and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.This is the second largest island in West ake--Landscaped in typical Chinese style.It has many small pavilions,terraces,display rocks and flower beds.The guide as a pretty girl.She told us the story about this island,I was so interesting,Untilnow.I can remember the whole story,and I often tell the other people,Then we traveled the lake by boat,The water was green clear and very quiet.We sat on the oat and enjoyed the beautiful scene.I suddenly pelt that I became a fairy maiden.Travling in the fairyland.On both side of lake,there are two dikes--the Bai and the su.On the each dike.You can see a row of vigorous willow trees.They are decorated with coloruful light,so in the evening,you can imagine how beautiful it is,There are many lovers under the tree.This place is really strongly impressed on my memory.People say in heaven is paradise,on earth are Suzhou and Hangzhou.This saying is true.I have been to two kinds of restaurants.The High class restaurant and the low class restaurant.When you enter a high class restaurant,you must dress well.There is a beautiful girl at the door,standing behind a counter,she will ask you did you make reservation If not,she will lead you to a table.Then,two or three waitresses in uniform will come to you,one will make tea for you.Other one will bring you a small hot towel.Another one will stand beside you,waiting you to order food,she often introduces the most expensive food or drinks to you.She is so patient and hospitable that you don't want to refuse her.She smiles broadly on her face,try her best to please you.She is so skillful I sometimes wonder whether she graduated from public relation school.When you look around,everywhere is so quiet.People talk in low voice.Of course,the environment and condition of the restaurant are luxurious.Maybe,some people think the food of the high clan restaurant is cleaner than the low class one.I don't think so,I think the food is clean unless you go into their kitchen.The service charge of high lass restaurant will make you headache.During the meal,you can not talk freely.You must have good table manner.Sometimes,fter you finish your meal,you still feel hungry.But the bill of the meal is very expensive.There is not this kind of case in low class restaurant.We usually call""Da Pai Dang""when center there,you will feel more comfortable,It seems everyone is your friend,you will feel like stay at your home,you can order food at your own will,Although the environment is not o good,you feel so free.Instead of controlled by others.There is no service charge there and the tea is free too.You can talk willingly.After you finish the meal,you will think it is worth to spend money there.Friend Friend is one part of our life.Everybody has friend.Some peoples have many friends.Because they like to make friends.They think friends are as important as their life.Without friends,they will feel lonely,everything will became meaningless.And live a happy life.To other people,Making friends is not them interest.They think building up friendship with a friend is wasting time,and friends will bring them trouble.They enjoy loneliness.To another people,they don't the many friends.Two or three close friends are enough for them.They found real friendship only can be built up among two or three people.So,different people have different opinion to define friends.A friend indeed is a friend in need.This is my definition of a friend.When I come across difficulty.She can give her hand to me.And tries her best to help me get out of trouble.In daily life,we can share joys and sorrows.Once,I got fever.It was very serious I felt too sick go to class.In school.I can do nothing.Only lay in bed all the day.I didn't drink and eat,my illness became more and more serious.Atthat time,I missed my so much family,I even cried on the bed.Susan knew this,she came to my room quickly after class.And gave me a few words of comfort.She took me to the school clinic.Cooked meal for me and took good care of me.I cried the second time.Because I was so moved that I could not help crying.I realized I really had a real friend.In my daily life.I observed some different phenomenon which people treat their When some girls have boy friend,they don't like to make other friends,even girlfriend.They think a boyfriend is enough for them.They only like to spend all the spare time with their lover.To me.I can't accept this.This will make me crazy.And become more and more unsociable and uncommunicative.Rose is my roommate.She is very lovely and amiable.We always play together,going to the classroom hand in hand every morning,making joke in our dormitory.Weeven talk heart each other.She has become my close friend since we knew each other.Many times,after she went back home,I felt very lonely on campus and waited for her return.Yesterday morning,something happened to us,I am used to to the VOA at7:00AM.So I get up earlier than Rose.Other roommates usually go out very early.So rose and I are the last two to leave.The room was so quiet yesterday morning.I knew only Rose was still in bed.I concentrated my mind on the VOA report.Suddenly,I felt two hands was holding my neck tightly behind me.""Oh,ghost!'I couldn't help jumping up from the chain and crying and then.I turned back,""Oh,my God,it is you,""I shouted angrily,""You want to scare me to die""?I felt a little pain on my neck,""I just wanted to play with you,I didn't mean it,why you are so angry to me""She replied and her voice seemed almost to cry.I didn't look at her and sat back to my chain.She walked away.We didn't talk to each other for a long time.I thought of myself that maybe I was too serious just now,always make joke.I persuaded myself to forget it.I looked at the watch.It was nearly the time for clan.I took the bookbag and walked to the chain.""Shall we go to the classroom""I said gently.She still kept silence on our way to classroom.I told her a humorous conversation.Last Sunday was my birthday and my mother asked me.""What kind of gift do you want me to send you""I prefer a peace and quiet environment""I answered.My mother entered into my room and moved out my treasured recorder.eally,This humorous conversation gained Rose's smile.",6

390,"??Practise mercy killing in China?Yes.Euthanasia is an action to,under his request,end a person's life when he has got an incurable disease.this method should be legalized in China.I offer three reasons here.First,it is a relief to a patient.When you are ill,you will suffer from it,even if it is only an ordinary one.You've got to go to the doctor's from time to time,take medicine regularly,and rest more,leaving your duties at work and at home to be fulfilled by others.However,in the case of an incurable disease,things will become much more serious.Immense physical suffering is not avoidable.You body is swallowed by viruses bit by bit.This makes you feeling that you are living in the Hell.It is impossible to enjoy an ordinary life.Hospitable becomes your permanent home,or at least a place where you visits every day.If you are fortunate enough to stay at home,all you can do is to rest in bed,waiting for you families care.No watching TV.No playing basketball.No working.You cannot find any meaning in you life.All you could do is to wait helplessly,painfully for the end of your life,the end of the pain.You suffer tremendous torment from the disease,both physically and mentally.Mercy killing can end all these painlessly.Moreover,it can also end the suffering of you families.Your family members suffer no less than you.You are the one they love greatly.They are as painful as you to see you suffer from the disease.You become the centre of their lives.They spend a lot of time and energy to take good care of you,to comfort you.They have become mentally and physically exhausted long before the end of your life.Whatsmore they are confronted with a critical problem:money.It costs a large sum of money to have medical treatment on these diseases.Take the comatose as an example.Statistics show that medical treatment for a patient of this costs26,000yuan a year.This is an astronomical figure to us Chinese.China is a developing country.Though its economy has been increasing at a high speed,the average income level in China is still very low.A large sum of population is only capable of having three meals every day.When such a tragedy happens to them,they will be pushed immediately into dispair How can you afford it when you annual income is only about one thousand yuan.Even when you are better well-off,this cost is not to be considered low.The burden on your family is incredible.In this case,mercy killing can help your family.Third,it is also a chance to induce ideological reform to legalize euthanasia in China.In antient times,moral principles are required to be followed strictly.When you were ill,you were supposed to be taken care of by your families.If you could not work you were supposed to be suported by others,regardless of you conditions,till the end of your life.China has developed greatly,but not many changes have taken place in the field of ideology.A lot of out-dated traditional concepts are still in existence.Like on the issue of euthanasia,many Chinese still hold that it should not be allowed to be practised in China,because it is immoral,it is against our traditional values.They have been steeped in tradition,from their claim we can tell definitely.Of course,a large part of our conditional values are to be inherited,like diligence,honesty,inventive.But this does not mean that we should inherit traditions without discrimination.Some antiquated ideas should be get rid of so as to make room for new ones.This can enable our nation to catch up with the development of the world.Isn't it better for the patient for his family,for our country to end his horrible suffering in a reasonable way when we could no longer do things on his disease?If we could think like this,so could we on other subjects.We would become more realistic and rational,which is extremely important to the further development of our country.So,euthanasia should be legalized in China,for the sake of our society,as well as of he him himself and his own family.",6
391,"My View on Fake our life,we often need to buy something that should be used by us.But now you will find that the things we bought have contained more and more fake commodities.If you buy a pair of new shoes,and want to tomorrow go to the cinema.But only after you used it for a day.It can not works any longer,I think,you will be angry.For another example,you buy a pair of glasses,but you still see the blackboard well....All of these will bring us a lot of trouble.To avoid these facts,everyone of us must take steps.The government must punish those who product or sell fake commodities.We,as consumers,should not buy those goods.And,Once we find those shop or people sell fake commmodities,we should report it to the government.I think,if we go all our best,we could make our life more better.",5

393,"D""??Euthanasia Should be legalized in China Euthanasia or mercy killing is a way to hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally.Euthanasia is not a kind of murdering,it is only a practical method to help a comatose patient himself to gain relief from suffering and help to relieve the heavy burden of his family and the hospital.And now,view on death of Chinese people is death in some way is not a failure,a horrible thing.So euthanasia should be legalized in China.Euthanasia is not like murder.Murder means killing a person unlawfully and on guilty purpose.Before murdering,the murdered does not know his death is coming and he is not a hopelessly ill individual without consciousness.Futhermore,murdering seriously influence social order.While euthanasia is different from First,it should be on the request of patients.When a patient is on the fringe of death and suffers great pain from the illness,if he requests doctors to help him to end the suffering and let him die,euthanasia may be considered.Second,it should be praticed on the agreement of his family and relatives.If his family members do not want to fasten his death in artificial way,euthanasia won't be used.Thirdly,before euthanasia is praticed,doctors will have discussion to decide whether the patient has hope for living or not.If there is hope for surviving,mercy killing won't be exercised.Patients who ask for mercy killing have different kind of circumstances.Some are really comatose and tortured from great pain,but some just do not want his family to hear the expensive medical cost and ask for death.So,doctors will consider the condition of the patients seriously before using euthanasia on the patients.Therefore,euthanasia is not a kind of murder,it is a useful way to help the patient to end the suffering because every step is considered carefully on the benefit of the patients.Futhermore,euthanasia not only helps hopelessly ill patients relieve from torturing,but also help to relieve his family's heaven burden mentally and physically.General speaking,Chinese people do not live in a highly living condition,most people are still poor,it is not easy for a nomal family to support the expense of a comatose patient who lives on medical for the expense is astonishing.Maybe one day's medical cost will support the whole family for a month.If obviously this patient has little hope for surviving,and he has alredy had no interest in living in the world,mercil killing can do him and his family good.Outside of the expense,it is not easy for his family member to hear to look at him lying in hospital with little hope to live.As we all know,cancer destroys a person's health greatly.If you see one of your family members,or relatives lying in the bed suffering pointed pain,loses his weight day by day and struggles with the pain sufferingly,what do you feel?Do you want to help him to release his suffering?Most people would like to help him,I think.So mercy killing can help the patient's family to relieve heavy burden mentally and physically.Moreover,as the illiteracy rate in China is quite high,many children born in rural ereas has no opportunities to be educated,because of proverty If we transmit the expensive medical expense on a patient with little hope for surviving to some poor children,we can train many talent for the future development of the country.So euthanasia can release the burden of the society and help the nation to develop the next generation.Also now,views on death of Chinese people are changing.To some old people,death is not as horrible as it was.Death is a normal and natural stage of life.A survey of200old people shows that92percent do not fear death.They do not want a long waiting period.They want to die with dignity and death instead of agony and degration A report in Beijing Daily said.From this survey,we can see death is no longer a horrible thing to old they would like to choose a peaceful way to die.To conclude,euthanasia is not a crime and it can help the patient and family members to relieve sufferings and help society to release burden,and above all,people would like to choose peaceful way to die without suffering in China,so euthanasia should be legalized in China.",6
394,"?o?Euthanasia or mercy killing is still not widely practised in China.And there is no law in China to allow or prohibit euthanasia.But according to the real situation,euthanasia should be legalized in China.China is a developing country.Comparing with the developed countries,such as the United States,Chinese hygiene level is rather low,especially in rural areas.Many people suffer from diseases without any treatment.Some people can not afford to pay high medicine fees.Even in urban areas,many people are suffering from cancers or other painful diseases.In such cases,practising euthanasia is good for the country.The country can use the limited money to improve the hygiene level and develop medical treatment for a comatose patient costs26,000yuan a year.Under the free medical service system,the country bears all the costs.Such a large amount of money can be used to give medical treatment to thousands of people in rural areas.It is really beneficial to the people.The euthanasia is good to the country and beneficial to the people.And at the same time,it is good to the patient who is suffering and his relatives who are also suffering.If the patient suffers extreme pain and there is no chance for recovery,euthanasia should be allowed.A person should have the freedom to decide when and how to die.From another angle,to help the patient to release from pain is humane.There is no reason for the doctors and his relatives who love him very much to extend the patient's suffering and give pain and sorrow to their beloved.And euthanasia can be a great relief to their family members,both mentally and physically looking after the patient is time-consuming and the relatives are even more toilsome.Therefore,euthanasia is good to the patient and his relatives.Man should be free to chose his lifestyle,including death.When a person is better off death and it is good to the country and his relatives,euthanasia should be allowed.Euthanasia should be legalized in China.",6
395,"The Difference Between Two Festivals As we all know,Christmas Day is the biggest and the most beloved holiday in the United States.The Spring Festival is the biggest festival in China.It's the time to celebrate the end of the year,the reuniting of families and friends,and the looking forward to a brand new year.However,they also have different aspects in celebration.Firstly,the time is different.Christmas day is being celebrated on December25th,while the Spring Festival is being celebrated on December,31st of lunar calendar.Secondly,the activities of celebration are various.In the United States people have a big dinner on the eve of Christmas Day.The food includes golden butter cookee,coffee squares,gingerbread,chocolate fudge,candy and so forth.The parents put their gifts on their children's stockings,decorate the Christmas tree with candles and presents;send cards to their relatives and friends.All these activities color the air of celebration.In China we also have a big dinner on the eve of Spring Festival.Especially in the North China,people eat special food:Jiaozi and noodle.Besides,parents will give children the Lucky money,which implies blessings and hopes.During this festival,people will visit and send gifts to their friends and relatives.Children fire the crackers and fireworks,which makes them very excited.Finally,the decorations are also different.In the United States the poinsettia plant,evergreens and the holly are most common decorations.The gay poinsettia row is most highly cherished.Its rich red and green make this plant most appropriate for Christmas.The evergreens are used to decorate the house,which bring in blessings and good luck.The holly berries are used to dot the green branches.In China we put the gatepost couplet and the door god on the door.The former expresses the hope and blessing,the latter is regarded as the talisman,who protect the family against danger.This tradition has lasted for more than a thousand years.In a word,these two festivals have similarities and differences and we do hope comings.",6

412,"Haste Makes makes waste""is a well-known saying in China.You may ask;why does haste make waste?First,if you want to achieve your ambition,you'll have to make some investigations in advance,you must make some necessary preparations and study some basic knowledge,but a hasty man will neglect all these things above,so he is doomed to fail,during he procedure,the hasty man will do some work hurrily He will make some serious mistakes that be avoided if he works carefully.Some student don't study hard at school.They study hard just before the examination.They spent whole night in studying during those days,they made great efforts in order to pass the examinations,but a lot of them failed to do Maybe they forget that haste makes waste Inmy opinion all great men achieve success through devotion,good preparation,diligence and perseverance.People,esp those lazy students,must learn to know""haste makes waste"".Haste Makes is well-known that haste makes waste.I think there are two reasons,first,people do something in a hurry,they often have mot enough preparing and they are easy to Second,sometimes the haste may lead a wrong behave which does not agree with the law of the things,in one world,haste makes Now,I'd like to give some examples.Firstly,the haste of a people who wants to catch a train usual is a bad thing,because the people are anxious,he always goes out in a hurry.And he is so anxious that he often leaves some thing important at home.as,the tickets,if the unfortunate thing happened,he would have is return and he would have less time to catch the if I want to do something,we must take enough time to prepare for it,because haste always leads to failure.Secondly,sometimes because of too anxious people will do something breaking it's own development law.For example,if a person wants to eat the eggs,he can buy it in the market but,if he killed hen he will lose a hen and many eggs in future.Though,this is a acient It is also instructive today.Through the two examples we can conclude that haste makes waste,so,in order to do things well,we must carefully prepare for it and obey the law of the things.Haste Makes I study in school,teacher often teaches me""Haste Makes Waste"".When I ask""why?"",he explains to me:""when you want to finish a thing,first you must think it careful you must understand what you should do?But if you do it hastily and without care,you will miss some important small parts,and then you will make waste.I even thought these words over and I realized that these words were good.I even make several mistakenes because I didn't believe""Haste Makes Waste.""Inthe middle school,my markes was low.And I want to improved my study.First I studyed hard without care,so I make waste.When I studyed careful,my markes is high.Haste Makes is a Chinese proverb---Haste makes waste.Thatmeans if you do something in a hurry,you won't do it successfully.Doing things successfully bases on two steps:first,you should make up your mind how to do it.This needs experience,knowledge of all kinds,intelligence,etc.If you have done it before,you may think that how you did last time and overcome the shortcoming.If you haven't done it,you do must think of it.That will help you do it with confidence.If you do it without thinking,just in a haste,you will probably fail.Second,you must do what you do carefully and skillfully.You must know that your purpose is not speed,but is quality and success.You see,a student who is doing his homework wants to play with his classmates,he wants to finish the work quickly and then he can Inthe end,he finds that the quicker he wants to be,the poorer the work he have done.So we should not do things in a hurry.Do remember---Haste makes taste.Haste Makes People almost think haste is a better thing,if car,ship,plane and train are faster,you will get the goal If you can study fast,you will make the mark.But not all things are so glad.may learn about this reason from our history and reality.In1958,all people echoed Mao Zhedong's call and did their bests building the country.They intented to turn into modern developed country.Inresult,the economic was back.Nowaday,many factories tried to catch up with the factories of the developed countries.They tried their bests altering their condictions.Because they didn't think other facter such as pollution,market.At last,many products can't sell,factories were bankrupted.Whether haste is good or bad,we must make the result from all facters we can't purily think""Haste must be good"".Sometimes,haste makes waste.Haste Makes Chinese old saying says""Haste makes waste"".Why?Your excessive desire is far from your real capacity and preparation.You expect too much and is short of doing the enormous fundmental upon which success must base.Achievement only reaches the good ready mind.Now a fact exemplifies the above.Inthe early of1990's,the housing estate market developed so stipulating that the large amount of housing has been storing till now.This caused directly the flowing capital delayed and the stressful economic situation at that time.The key is all housing businessmen desiring to make a large fortune at a day enlarged the market undemanded at random.The developing speed of housing estate market was beyond above the normal economic increasing speed.The overquick increase has conservly brought about the loss of economy.Haste Makes is often heard that the old and experienced people always give the young men such a good sentence:""Haste makes waste.""It is easy for you to understand it Most of us have such a experience.We are planning to do something very urgent.When some one else continues to hurry you up again and again and finally you will do nothing successfully.If you want to get something done perfectly,you should have a good plan first and then consider it from all aspects.It must lead to failure if you are eager to finish it quickly.For example,one time my brother was planning to have a birthday party for my mother.So he telephoned all friends and relatives of my family to invite them to have dinner at our home.But in a hurry,he forgot to count how many guests he invited.At last we were very embarrassed that some of our guests were hungry after birthday party because we hadn't had enough food.On the whole it tells us whatever we do,we should plan and then do it carefully.Haste is no lead to success sometimes haste just wastes time or causes failure.Haste Makes would never forget the matter which happened last year.I received an order for200cartons of Chinese tea for my American client.So I asked the workshop to produce When the director asked me when to deliver the goods,I answered,""The sooner the better""in order to get payment earlier.Two weeks later,200cartons were but the quality was poor,because usually,we need one month to produce such amount.Of course,the client was angry and refused to pay a dollar.We wasted a lot of time,money and energy but got nothing.From then on,I have understood what our saying""Haste makes waste""means.Speed is important,but it must be based on quality.High speed can be accepted only when the quality is high,too.Otherwise,the result will be nothing but waste.I think it is necessary for everybody to remember""Haste makes waste.""Haste Makes we do a thing,which is the more important:the speed?good result?We usual think both of them can be got is the best result But if you must choose one from them,thegood result is more important.I used to have met such a thing.When I was nine,I wanted to learn writing.I saw some other pupil could draw beautiful pictures.I thought it would be wonderful if I can.So I began to learning When I made a little progress,I wished how I can draw pictures quickly and wonderfully.Thus,I practised until I finished a picture in only several minutes.But when I showed these pictures to others,they said they're worse than before.After this,I thought for a long time.I understood before I hadn't made a good foundation,I couldn't have demand it speed It struck me deeply.Today,I still remember the thing.It proved a piece of words.""Haste makes waste"".When we do things,we should first have enough abilities to do it better,then the speed may be required.Haste Makes is true that haste makes waste.If someone doesn't know the way he is going to,and he runs fast unconciously,we are sure that he will never reach anywhere in the end.The same as to building if we want to build a house in a hasty regardless of the basement of the house.The house that we will have built up is dangerous for us to live.So,we must rebuild it again.It wastes time and energy.For achieving a thing is not a easy work.We should learn to be patient and work step by step.Patient is not needed in the work,but also in study.If we try to learn English well,we should remember English words each day.Day after day,we can enlarge our vocabulary,and we can read and write English more correctly.But,it is a period of learning.It needs time.Rome was not built in a day.So,we can conclude that we should work hard and patiently both in life and our study.Only that we can success in our life and work.",5

450,"??1a?Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Death,a fearful concept for most people,is now changing its position in people's mind.Since Dr.Sanders medically ceased his patient's suffering,mercy killing has been put into discussion,which has launched a compaign to revalue the means of death.Hence,with a scientific and psycological consideration,many Chinese agree that euthanasia should be legalized in China.First,people have the right to die.Death,an inevitable process,is as natural as birth.Birth and death are both natural events,but the emotional impact and the personal meanings of these events are vastly different.Birth is usually antispated with excitement and joy,while the reality of death is often avoided as best one can.However,death should not be viewed as a failure.When a dying patient is suffering from torturous pain,death may relatively be a precious gift.Since induced aboction is legalized in controling birth in China,euthanasia can be treated as a legal ending to people's life away from torturous pain.Second,euthanasia can not only cease the painful life but also save a lot of medical treatment.A survey of200old people shows that92per cent do not fear death.They do not want a long waiting period.They want to die with dignity and peace,instead of agony and degradation.From this angle,euthanasia is a progressive way to die.And it accord with the will of the old.Futhermore statistics indicate that medical treatment for comatose patient costs26,000yuan a year,a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family.If the disease can be treated in a short time and the patient can recover as normal the amount of money is worth spending Otherwise,it is a great loss.In this case,euthanasia can help us solve the problem.Third,euthanasia should be put forward with legalization.Euthanasia is now quietly being practised in some urban areas of China despite a lack of legal protection for the death option.This situation is very dangerous,for it provides chances for crimes.So legal system in China should soon be established to deal with euthanasia lest some scoundrel perform killing for benifits,making use of euthanasia.",6

485,"??Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China Euthanasia,ormercy killing,is a very controversial issue world wide.In this debate,those who are against it argue that anyone who voluntarily,knowingly orpremediatedly takes the life of another is a killer,while those who are forit retort that people have the right to die.I personally think that euthanasia under given conditions is humane and taht it should be legalized in China.My stand is based on the following reasons.Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane.When there is no chance forrecovery fora patient who suffers extreme pain,is it humane to artificially maitian his orher life?The purpose forhuman beings to develope medical science is to free patients from physical ormental sufferings,or,as it were,to bring relief to patients.Extending an incurably ill patient's life runs counter to this purpose,forit is absolutely not a relief but aggravation of his orher pain.Since euthanasia is not yet legal in China,many patients can not legally pput on end to their extreme sufferings and what their relatives and doctors can do is to share their sufferings at the same time.Chinese people attach great importance to""face"",or""dignity"".They want their life be meaningful when they are alive and want to die with dignity and peace.Euthanasia helps keep them from the agony and degradation of death when death is inevitable and when they are suffering great pain before dying.Euthanasia is nto only a relief to indivisuals but a relief to the hospital and even the country.Statistics indicate that medical treatment fora comatose patient costs26,000yuan a yeay a heavy burden to the hospital and the country,forChinese urban citizens enjoy free medical service,which means that indivisuals only pay a small percentage of the fee of medical treatment whereas the government pays forthe rest of them.Patients who want to resort to euthanasia are usually those who are suffering from incurable diseases such as cancer.It is very expensive to continue to treat their disease in order to maitain their life.If euthanasia is legalized,a large sum of money can be saved.It deserves attention that my support to euthanasia requires some contitions,as stated in the first paragraph.First,the patient should be treminally ill.Those who suffer from physical disability like George Zygnamiak,who can still lead a meaningful life if he does not give up hope,should not resort to to euthanasia.A good example is Zhang Haidi,who is well known in China because she has managed to make her life meanful although she is paralyzde from the waist down.My point is that we should not give up trying when there is still hope,especially thta can be attained by a strong will.Second,euthanasia must be the terminally ill patient's repeated request.It must be a choice of his orhre own accord.Third,an evaluation body should be established to judge which requests fora mercy killing are valid before the act is committed.Fourth,euthanasia must be carried out by professional doctors.Other people such as the the relatives of the person who want to be killed mercifully should not be allow to commit such an act.The reason formy support to the legalization of euthanasia in China is that only through such a process can the above four requirements individuals but also prevent the abuse of euthanasia.It is indeed a thing worth doing.",6

Year)3.Dumplings4.Evening show by CCTV SpringFestival When we talk about festivals,SpringFestival will come first.It is not only because it comes on the first day of the lunar New Year,but also it has great significance for Chinese all over the world.Maybe it is as important as the Christmas Day in western countries.We Chinese regard spring as the beginning of a new year.At the beginning of the new year,we always have great wishes for the coming year.So celebrations for the SpringFestival in China also mean that.You can see that from the greetings at that time¨C all of them are best wishes for the new year's fortune and health.With the development of the society,many new customs have joined the old ones.Both of them have made up of the celebrations of the SpringFestival.Go down town on SpringFestival,you may find some Temple Fairs.Because in the old days,there were always some fairs around temple the name of""Temple Fair""continued.In the countryside,there are also some small fairs a few days before the SpringFestival.There you can find dragon-lantern play and stilt etc.People play in great din of gongs and drums,expressing the joyance and wishes for another harvest year.When the night curtain falls down,firecrackers and fireworks display became the theme everywhere.Colorful fires with resounding crack.You may feel deaf after hearing that,but that won't diminish your happiness But to the concerns of pollution and public health,governments in big cities began to control the fireworks.So cassettes of firecrackers'sound became popular in some big cities.Paying a new year call is also essential to Chinese.You can find people busy shuttling from place to place to send their best wishes.Telephone,mobile phones,beepers and email release people a lot.They can enjoy themselves saying""Happy SpringFestival""to friends and folks without hustle.For those who work and study far away from their hometowns,SpringFestival means more.Then a big family get-togetheris always on the SpringFestival's Eve.All the members sit around the table to share the delicious Nianyefan(New Year's Eve Dinner).And dumplings are essential to everyone.In my hometown¨C Shandong¨Cdumplings have various tastes,you may find a coin in one dumpling if you are lucky enough.After that nearly all of us will stay up in front of the TV to watch the evening by CCTV and wait for the coming of a new year.With the development of the society,SpringFestival has changed a lot.But one thing will not change that the Chinese people's best wishes for the peace and happiness!Is

too cruel?You don't understand what a devil my brother was when we were small In the summer when I was three and my brother was just over eight,my mother took us for a walk in the evening.She put me in a baby wheelchair,and asked my brother to care for his little sister.My brother,out of his interest in the wheelchair,played with it at his will.He swung it from side to side swiftly,and back and forth,taking no notice of his scared-to-death little sister in the hell-like wheelchair.Maybe he felt it still not stimulating enough,or he wanted to test the hardness and the stability of the

and cruel Instead,an elder sister would be fantastic:you can wear her clothes,confide your secrets to her and get millions of marvelous gifts from her.An elder sister?My brother laughed,Oh,only silly

believe anyone can be that silly.It tastes good Forrest Gump's mother said that life was like a box of chocolate.And I think many kinds of experiences are just like a lot of styles of chocolate with different flavours and tastes.If it is the first time we eat that kind of chocolates,we can never successfully expect how it tastes.Is it a sweet milk chocolate or a slightly bitter black chocolate?Is it mixed with peanut or strawberry?Is it a fresh one or an expired one?All these questions cannot be answered correctly until we have put one into our mouth.The condition is the same when we experience something new,No matter how well we are prepared,we always run into something unexpectedly.Raising fund for an activity sounded challenging and interesting.Although I was a layman to that task,I took it over.I ever heard that""be prepared,or you won't make it"",so I spent half a week in making all kinds of preparations.As I thought making a telephone call was more polite than visiting the office,I found a telephone book and transcribed dozens of telephone numbers without noticing that the telephone book was published three years ago.Then the next thing to do was to choose a lucky day to call them.It was a clear day.And my roommates had gone to the classroom.After a big breakfast that I thought could increase my confidence,I sat beside the phone,drew a deep breath,and made sure that I was clear-minded.As I know it was a very tough work,I,first of all,thought carefully about the subject and what question I could expected and most convincing way to answer them.I even wrote some key points on a yellow pad.Unexpectedly,that most deliberate preparation I had ever made rendered nervous Realizing that I had wasted a lot of time in thinking the too detailed problems and getting my nerve more and more tense,I had to start my work.I could not remember how I picked up the telephone,pressed the button When the unacquainted voice came from the other side of the phone,I suddenly revived and spat out the entire subject as quickly as I could.To my shock,the answer from the other side was""sorry,I think you've dialed the wrong number"",""no this is not the Shell Company"".Thinking that failure is the mother of success I made the second one,the third one.After being refused for several times I found I had wasted a lot of time in explaining enthusiastically to an operator of the switchboard and given up easily when hearing the manager's cold words.Gradually I learned how to illustrate briefly to the operator and how to talk to the department manager to bring him or her around.However,the whole thing was far more complicated than I had anticipated.All the bright managers required a fax about the activity and the budget.That challenging task suddenly turned into a routine one.I had to write and print the letter,being obsessed with the title,the tone and the pattern.I felt I turned from an annoying sales dealer into a patient secretary.Just as an old saying said""nothing is impossible to the effort and courage"",our activity got the biggest certified public accountants'assistant.I made an appointment with the manager to acquire the donation.Unfortunately it was a rainy and windy day.As credit was the most important thing,nothing can prevent me from going there.On my way to the office,the rain got heavier and heavier,moreover the wind destroyed my umbrella.When I stepped into the hall of the World Trade Center,I was soaked through and like a drenched chicken.The waiter looked at me pointedly.As I didn't like to be questioned and drove away.I step forward and asked where is the CPAs office.He was quite shocked and pointed at the elevator and said""on the eleventh floor"".Through all these unexpected difficulties I got the

517,"(t9-1)According to the dictionary feminism is the belief that woman should have the same rights,power,and opportunities as men.Feminists are those who believe in and support feminism.In my opinion feminists have done much good to the cause of women.Feminism helps to promote women's position both in society and family.As far as women's social status is concerned,nowadays there are quite a large number of female politicians,scientists,professors,doctors,etc.Women have almost entered every field of work.Politically speaking women have the same right to vote and be elected as men.Now female political leaders are not a rare thing as we see that former British prime minister Tharcher is a well-known woman politician.Some people'belief that politics belongs to men is no longer accepted by both men and women since many facts have proved this belief wrong.Thatcher is a good example.Economically speaking women are able to earn as much money as men.In the current of reforming women take up doing business as well as men and some get quite rich.It is no longer true that making money is men's task.Women can do the same.In addition girls can do as well as boys in school.Many teachers have noticed the phenomenon that in the early years of education girls averagely tend to receive higher marks than boys.This provides strong evidence for the idea that women and men are mentally equal though they cannot be physically equal.We have to admit that men are stronger than women with regard to physical strength.But this difference does not exist in the aspect of mental ability.Many girls get their MA or doctor's degree as well.Since in so many aspects women's ability is the same as men's,why should not women get the same rights and opportunities as men?Before women were liberated from the traditional view that women are born family caretakers,they were bound to their children,husbands,and families.They did housework all day long.No opportunity was provided for them to participate in social activities.Under such conditions how can women show their talent?We can be sure to say that many talented women lost the opportunity to become somebody.In this sense feminists have done much good to the cause of women because their belief contributes to the establishment of women's self-confidence and self-respect.Because of feminism women can have their own cause for which they exert themselves.Once offered the same opportunities as men,women are able to compete with men and even surpass them in some aspects.For example,teacher seems to be one of the favourite professions for women.One reason may be that women are apt to love students due to their experience of looking after their own children.They may like to be with children to help them grow healthily,and to impart knowledge.Being a woman she possesses particular qualities that can never be found in a man.So it is unfair to say that women are inferior to men.Since all men are created equal,women should have the same rights,power,and opportunities as men.What feminists have done is greatly helpful to the cause of women.No one can disregard the achievement of feminism in discovering women's ingenuity for the society's use.",6

527,"A Character Sketch of Galileo Galileo was born inPisa,Italy,in1564.As a boy,he showed a scientific talent:observant,curious,and non-conformable.As he grew up,his desire of probing the mystery of the things became more and more intense,his dissatisfaction with what the authority ordered to obey became stronger and stronger.After he entered the University of Pisa,Galileo became more active to testify his hypothesis with experiments and he was brave enough to challenge the great Aristotle.Although he was considered an idiot and a heretic,he just turned a deaf ear to such""criticism and dedicated himself to the pursuit of truth.After he went to Padua,where the intellectual air was much more freer than Piza,Galileo reached the height of life.All his life Galileo invented a lot of things(for example,the compass,the thermometer and the telescope)and discovered many nature laws(such as the Theory of Falling Objects,the isochronism of Pendulum).Actually Galileo was a follower of Copernicans and he dared to declare there are spots inthe sun.In the atmosphere of Middle Ages,Galileo was just like a shining star inthe dark sky.His contribution was bejond comparison.Yet just as the sun also has spots,Galileo was not perfect.From a critical point of view,Galileo should have achieved more if he hadn't made the deadly decision to return to Pisa,where the power of Inquisition was very strong.However,with an eagerness to return intriumph to his hometown and to show how injust they had treated him,Galileo returned to Pisa brashly.Soon he suffered the consequence of his decision--He was oppressed,summoned and deprived of the basic rights by the Inquisition and finally was sentenced to death.Psychologically speaking,Galileo's mind was not broad enough so that he sacrificed his career for the fame.Yet it was really difficult for Galileo to break through the dense nets made by the authority of his times.He deserved the respect and memorial from all over the world.In my opinion,he is not only a great scientist,but also a brave warrior.",6

536,"????Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Mercy or murder?Innocent or guilty?These are the questions that many people may argue when they talk about euthanasia.Euthanasia,or called mercy killing,is the painless killing of incurably ill or old people.when I say""euthanasia should be legalized in China"",I mean that it should not only be morally accepted by Chinese public,but also be made by law.The approval of euthanasia is an essential step.I have several reasons to justify it.First,death is not a failure or evil,but a normal and natural stage of life.China is not a Christian country,where committing suicide is regarded as blaspheming the gods.Therefore,Chinese should hold a scientific view on death.As natural as birth,death is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance,said Cai Wenmei,an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University.The adoption of""one-child policy""in China proves that it is legal to kill an unborn child,why,then,is it illegal to kill aperson who can never regain consciousness?People have the right to die.Second,expending an incurably ill patient's life has no difference from aggravating his pain.Euthanasia does the patient good rather than harm.If Dr.Herman N.Sanders didn't give the old lady four lethal injections of air,she may be still screaming out in anguish from her bed.If Lester M.Zygnmiak did not shoot his brother dead,his brother still suffers from being paralyzed form the neck down.If Mrs.Ross did not give her beloved daughter a bottle of strong sedative,the little girl may be now cruelly aware of her fate due to her severely disfigured body.What a relief to these people now!In this sense,euthanasia is a moral act.Third,artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can recover is a heavy burden for the country and the patient's family.Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs26,000yuan a year.This is too large a figure for an average Chinese to afford.When the family can not pay any more,the country will be burderned with the cost.China is still a rather poor country,and she can not look after so many these patients.She should invest her limited funds to construction,instead of paying too much for a""useless""person.Maybe what I have said is a little but cruel and inhumane,as you may condemn me,but I am talking sense.Facts prove that most people agree with any viewpoint.A survey in Beijing of200old people shows that92percent do not want to die with agony and degradation.They do not want a long waiting period.Another survey of more than10,000people taken by a local newspaper indicated that over98percent agreed with Mrs.Ross'action of conducting euthanasia to her daughter.Therefore,euthanasia should be morally accepted by the public.The legalization by law is another necessary step.Legal system should be established to deal with euthanasia,because it would invite abuse.some unscrupulouspersons might dub a murder with""mercy killing"",so that they can conveniently be immune to punlishment In any opinion,the conduct of euthanasia should be under three condictions.First,It should be at the patient's request or on his(or her)approval.If the patient is unconscious,this condiction can be ignored.Second,it should have the consent in writing of his(or her)relatives and the signature of a lawyer.Third,there should be joint approval of all medicalpersonnel attending the case after thorough examination and careful study of the patient.If there is still a shred of hope to cure the sickness and save the patients from agony,we must not give up.Euthanasia needs moral approval by the public and strict stipulations in law.Mercy or murder?Innocent or guilty?I think you have already had the right answer in your mind.",6

546,"?1/4??Euthanasia Sould Be Legalized In China Euthanasia,or mercy killing,which is still quite a new term for many Chinese,means to end a terminally ill patient's life after deliberation.China is a traditional and conservative society,the strict moral values often prevent people from understanding and accepting this method.But a lot of facts and experiences have proved that the proper use of this method is benefitial to patients themselves,their families and even the society.In order to make sure this method is used right and justifiably,it should be legalized in China.From the moral point of view,Euthanasia is humane because it helps to ease the pain and sorrow of those incurably ill patients.For those paralyzed and badly deformed people,life is almost meaningless,with no happiness and joy.They have to face agony mentally and physically every moment.Although they are living,they are being tortured in hell.To extend such a life is more cruel and inhamane than to end it.And above all,they have no chance to change this situation.It will be a nightmare to live the rest of their life like that.Moreover,the patient's family and friends will have to face many pressure and shoulder graet burden by seeing their beloved ones suffering and struggling helplessly all the time.In this hopeless situation,death is the only progressive way to go,where patients can find the peace and relief.It is absolutely moral to use such euthanaisa with the patients and the family's approval undr such despair circumstances.From the legal point of view,the legalization of euthanasia can protect the rights of patients and their doctors.Death is a normal and natural stage of life,people have their right to die when life become a process of suffering.We can't determine our birth,but we are in charge of our death.Hospitals and families should respect the dying person's rights and will to choose their way of life,including death.Death,which is like birth,sometimes requires assistance.So doctors have to take up this responsibility,which often causes a lot of controversies and disputes.The doctors who help patients to end their lives have the danger o facing murder charges.As a result,many doctors are reluctant to use euthanasia.In order to aviod misunderstanding and unnecessary conflicts,a series of rules and regulations should be established so that euthanasia can be carried out in a more harmonious and smooth way.To aviod the negative effects of euthanasia,the legalization of it is more necessary.Some people argued that""mercy killing""would invite a new form of murder conducted by unscrupulous persons.So if we establish a legal system with an evaluation body to judge the case before the act is committed,it will be much safer.Strict laws concerning euthanasia should be worked out:it should be performed only at the patient's request,with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.So if we legalize euthanasia in China,a lot of trouble and abuse can be avioded Many countries have legalized euthanasia and proved it to be workabl It is just a matter of time for China to do so.But Chinese people's deep-rooted ethnics make the general adoption of euthanasia a rough way,which still requires a lot of efforts.But no matter how difficult it is,the truth will finally be accepted.",6

571,"3??1/4Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China Euthanasia,or mercy killing,is the painless killing of incurably ill or old people.The practice of euthanasia recieved controversial opinions all over the world.Countries like Uruguay,Switzerland,Norway and Germany protect mercy killing in their laws,whereas in other countries,the issue still stand debate.What is the case in China,then?Time may not ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia according to the report in Beijing Daily.But from a long term point of view,euthanasia should be legalized in China.First of all.We'd better distinguish mercy killing from murder.Murder is conducted to the interest of the killer against the will of the victim.While mercy killing is done to end the pain of those sufferers so that they can be relieved from constant anguishes of life.It is often agreed upon by the recievers.This can be seen in following cases.In America,the famous doctor Sanders led his patient,a sixty year old woman who was dying of cancer to die painlessly by injection air into her veins.He did it not because he is a cruel doctor without mercy,but because he was moved by the sympathetic condition of his patient.Lester shot his older brother.George,who would be paralysed for life after an automobile accident.He was requested by his older brother to do so.It is almost the same with Harold Mohas,whose cancer sticken brother pleaded with him to act like that.The three of them did not kill others voluntarily.So we learn that murder and mercy killing are conducted from different motives for different purposes.They can not be viewed at the same level.Secondly,when life means no more than suffering and sorrow,it's better to go to heaven quietly and painlessly.Life almost always means happiness and success to people.It's no use to artificially maintain life when people can never regain consciousness or when they suffered intolerable pains from the simple concept of being alive.For these people,life is equal to hell.To survive has no significance except incessant pain.Death seems to be a better choice.That makes for the reason why Mrs.Ross killed her daughter,Paula.The baby girl was born severely disfigured with no arms,no legs and a deformed face.Though she has normal intelligence,this will only bring sorrow,frustration to her innocent mind.As a mother,Mrs.Ross hated to see her daughter to be tortured in the days to come.So she made the decision to hasten her daughter's death.In fact,it is inhumane to look on when others are stuck in great sorrow.We should offer a hand.And that is to let them leave the would with dignity and peace.Finally,euthanasia is a graet relief to their family members,both mentally and physically.As a close person who loves them very much,he/she may be tortured to witness their suffering.Besides,it's costly to get the money needed to maitiain the lives of those suffers It will a great burden to the whole family.I'm not saying that we shouldn't save dying people.I only mean that if the concept of living is changed,if it is not worth its while,death is acceptable.All in all,euthanasia should be given legal right not only from its motive,but from the consideration of the patients and their family members.After sincere studies,we should give euthanasia a warm welcome.",6

589,"Reading extensively is a good habit,it's necessary for us to form this habit.extensively is good to increase your word power,you can also get more background knowledge from the book you read extensively.Learning a foreign language,vocabulary is veer If you don't master enough words,you will have difficulty in progressing.however,to keep new words in mind is difficult to most of us.Reading extensively can help you this hard problem.In our daily life,we are familiar with the things we often see.It's the same in remembering new words,you can't remember a new word when you meet it first time,but you'll remember it after you meet it several times.extensively offers the chance to you to meet the new words again and again,that means reading extensively is helpful in mastering new words.extensively will also help you get more background knowledge During extensive reading,you will come across all kinds of subjects,and different you different knowledge.as time goes by,you will get different kinds of knowledge.As a result,the reading comprehension is just a piece of cake to you.In short,reading extensively is good to us,we should do more reading and take reading extensively as our hobbies.Reading extensively is most important part of learning English.reading extensively is the way that we know some information by In reading extensively class,we learn different reading methods and how to improve our reading speed.As we know,there are different goals in reading.For example,if we want to know the special information,we can use skimming.Second,we read a lot of passages within special time in the class.that make us speed up.The reading methods help us improve our reading speed.Reading extensively is a tool to know information by reading.when we are good at it,that,course,English level.I think it important to read extensively,although some people suggest reading intensively.Reading extensively can do much good to our study.If one read extensively,he can benefit a lot.first,he can increase his speed of reading.When you read more books,you will be familiar with the structure of a sentence,then,you can just cast your eyes on several words and understand the whole sentence Secondly,reading extensively can enlarge your command of vocabulary when you read some kinds of books on different field,you may come across some new words.don't need to look up the dictionary.It's certain that the word will appear in somewhere.From the text,you can try to guess its meaning.In this way,you can learn a lot of new words.Last but not the last,reading extensively is a real eye-opener.You mustn't always be concentrated on certain kind of books.It will limit your knowledge.You had better try your best to learn more,that means,had have to read extensively.In short,in my opinion,reading extensively is very useful to our command of knowledge.We benefit a lot from it.Books are good friends to us human beings.We learn things not only from experience but also more from books.Some people think we should read books extensively while others think it should do intensively.my opinion,we should read extensively.There are hundreds and a thousand books in the world,and also all kinds of books.Every book has its own value.So if we want to learn more things,we must read more and there is not enough time and no need for us to read every book carefully.We had to choose reading.Some books on your major should be read carefully;and some just for fun can only look it through.secondly,with the progress of socialty and in all aspect.In order to match this requirement,we should learn more,not only our major but also other Moreover,interests out of work can help us without an extensive base,how can we build a high building?In a word,reading can help us learn knowledge and extensive reading can make us learn more.Let's read extensively in a limited life.Reading extensively,as a way in learning English,is very helpful for me.First,reading extensively can increase my vocabulary,while reading some English works,many new words will appear in the lines,and I can guess their by reading between the lines instead of looking them up in the dictionary.words may be read from one work to another,and then impress me so much that I have remember them clearly,and my vocabulary is increased.Second,reading extensively can improve my gramma I can know more gramma knowledge by learning the authors'method of organizing words and sentences.Finally,reading extensively can also improve my writing I learn more background knowledge about different words and sentences by reading different kind of English works,then I can grasp their and use them fluently.In short,reading extensively is a helpful way for me to learn English well,and I think it's the same to others.Reading extensively can helps us a lot,especially to the English majors though it takes a lot of time.Firstly,reading extensively can enlarge our vocabulary.As you know,if we want to have a good command over English,we must have a large vocabulary.There are so many words for us to remember.Especially the new words and sometimes the longer words which are to remember.If we do more extensive reading,we can come across them in different situations.So will help us to remember them,at least to be morre familiar with them.if we run across a new word during our reading we can guess its meaning from the content.It also can help enlarge our vocabulary.Secondly,reading extensively can our knowledge.The more we read,the wider knowledge we have.Reading different kinds of books,varied level books can help us understand more about the world.Different kinds of books have varied contents and different characters.The knowledge we get from the lesson is limited.So we want to open our eyes,we must do extensive reading.Extensive reading benefits us a lot.It's very important for us to read extensively,because it can widen our sight and enlarge our knowledge.A person's knowledge is limited,he should read extensively to get reading extensively we know a lot.Reading travelling book,for example,makes us know the customs,of different country.Although we have little chance to get there,y reading it we can imagine the beautiful place.Most people think that they should read only the books which help them in their major.That is wrong.Take a businessman for example,books he should read are on not only economics but also politicals or anything else.As a businessman,he can take advantage of it.Moreover,when he contact with different people,he should know a lot to communicate with them then he can arrive with other people.In all,it's important and necessary to read extensively,and it can make our lives rich.It's said that reading extensively can make you intelligent.In my opinion,its really important for us students to do more reading.Thus we can learn more.Reading Extensively benefits you a lot,first of all,it can enrich your knowledge in wide such as science,culture,art,etc.maybe you'll not become an expert,but what you get from reading extensively is helpful for you to solve many kinds of problems.It's quite practical.Besides,reading more and reading extensively can make you intelligent.When you're reading,you use your brain to think,to remember.In this way,you can practice your brain's ability.By all means it helps us with our study a lot.he who wants to learn more and make more progress must do more extensive reading.In a word,reading extensively is essential and useful.all of us should do it.As everybody knows,reading is the most direct way to absorb knowledge.And reading extensively is of great importance in reading.Firstly,reading extensively can improve our reading skills.The old makes perfect'is always true.In order to make a master of certain thing,we must do a lot of practice.Only through reading extensively,we read a lot and learn a lot.The more we read,the better and aster can we understand what we read.Gradually,we can read much faster and without missing anything,extensively can save a lot of time and trouble in reading and improve the quality of our reading.Through reading extensively,can skim the article more quickly.In this way,we can not only select the art we interested to read and also those we don't in,but also grasp the article's main idea more quickly accurately.How essential is reading can benefit a lot from reading extensively.As a student,you should read extensively,because it is a good way for study.It's also a good habit.First,reading extensively is a good method of getting knowledge.The more you read,the more you know.You can learn from reading without moving.Just sitting there,you can read various kinds of books ranging from quide to novels,which means you can learn different kinds of knowledge ranging from science to literary Secondly,reading extensively is a good way to improve your reading skill.One can his speed of reading if he read a lot.He will know the structures of the sentences,if he reads so many similar sentences.So he can get the meanings of the sentences correctly.Besides,he can improve his vocabulary,because he will meet lots of new words when he do reading.Thirdly,reading extensively is a good way to relax yourself.You will forget everything annoyed when you are reading.short,if you consider reading extensively as your habit,instead of a boring thing,you can benefit from it a lot.Extensive reading,that means read books as many as possible,not just a certain kind of books but also all kinds of think do more reading is good for us.As a college student,our knowledge should not be confined to a certain range,we should know more,learn more.If we just read some kind of books,there will be a great blank place is wanted for us to explore.Take me for example,I like to read some books on history.When I do some exercise on computer or stock market,I find it difficult to understand,for I seldom read books on this respect.Currently,I realize that it's harmful,at least not good for us to meek progress.The world is so beautiful and the knowledge is endless.Every subject has its own value and knowledge,do more reading can enable us to have better understanding and widen our vision.But maybe someone will ask,if I put my whole heart on certain subject,perhaps I can be an expert.don't forget one thing,not everyone want be an expert,especially we will come across many kinds of things in our daily life.we obtain some kinds of knowledge on some expect,your will be more but that just depends on doing more reading.Do more reading is worthwhile.Reading extensively means to read all kinds of book,ranging from common knowledge to science materials.It is a very good way to enrich our knowledge.if no do so,we will know more about our society,our country and even the current events or anything else around the world.We live in a certain rang in the society.We may be familiar with what happen around us.However,what we know from the limited area is limited.We must stand in other ways to know more.Reading extensively is a good way.Take us for example,we live on the campus most of our time.if we don't read newspaper or listen to the radio,we don't know what happen outside.So,addition to our text book,we should read more books which are on economy,sport,entertainment and science.Knowing all kinds of information,we will study better.One more example,in our extensive reading course,there are all kinds of reading materials.we have never met such things,like the cause to rain,wind etc,we can't understand the article clearly.In a word,Reading extensively can enrich our knowledge.The more we do,the better.Extensive reading is an important course in language learning.It can increase the students'wordpower broad their knowledge of background and develop their abilities of reading comprehension.As we all know,reading is a basic ability in learning language,but we will learn limited knowledge just by intensive reading.Extensive reading has many advantages as compared with intensive reading.First,we acquired knowledge of many aspects through reading lots of material,which are unavailable in intensive reading.Second,we mostly learn grammar and other basic abilities in intensive reading.However,extensive reading provide us many articles,which contain a lot of new words.Thus learn more new words effectively through reading extensively,we develop the skills such as guess,estimation,which make us do better in reading comprehension and make progress in theIn a word,extensive reading is a good way to have a command of language.We learn primary language in intensive reading,whereas we learn broader language in extensive reading.If we can afford time to read all kinds of book,we can get a lot from it.Reading extensively can widen our eye and strengthen our ability of solving problem.First if we read extensively,we can know lots of things about our world,we can know things about from the sky to geography,from our motherland to the foreign country,from the history of the world to nowsday and even the future.Thus,we can keep up with the development of the world.Secondly,if we read all kinds of books,we can strength our ability of solving problem.take studying English for example,since the knowledges are connected with each other,English also is connected with geography and history of England or America will understand and learn better than those who have know little about the foreign That's why the teacher ask us to read more book about foreign country background.Reading extensively do lots of good to us.we should read good as many as possible and try to be a man who knows'something of everything and everything of something' .Reading extensively do good to you in some respect.It can improve your vocabulary.It can open your eye.It's my view on reading extensively.First,it can improve your vocabulary,We always come across a lot of unknown words,any we can remember them.If we read book,we can guess the meaning of the word accordingly to the contact.And we read extensively,the word always go into your eyes.you will remember it.In this way,you will remember a lot of worlds.Second,reading extensively can open your eye.As we know,we do not have enough thing to learn,to study,to know everything except our major,and we also do not have enough money to travel every place in the world.If we want to know something that we don't know,we can read book.We can learn lots of things from reading extensively.Teacher always tell us to read extensively.Because reading extensively do good to us in most respect.The most important for our English major is that,it can improve our vocabulary and open our eye.As we all know,reading is very important because it is the main way we get knowledge However,some people just do some reading on one or two subject.It is so limited and I think reading extensively is much better that that.Some people may say:It is enough if I'm much good at one subject.If you can change one subject very well,that's good but not enough.Because you will know nothing about other subject,and that will effect you major for many things are Reading extensively will open your eyes.On the other hand,reading extensively will improve you major study.Take ourselves for example,we major in English,so if we read more in English,we can not only get more knowledge on other subject but also improve our reading ability in English.Therefore,I think reading extensively is very good for us,for it can open our eyes and improve our major study.Nowadays,there are so many advertisement on radio and TV.The positive and negative effect of advertising are both obvious.Let us talk about the positive effect first.After a factory or a company produce a new product,it wants anyone to know the new product,in order to sell it succeefully On the other hand,some people want to buy certain kind of goods.By hearing or watching the advertisments they can have more choices to choose the one which is good enough.then let's focus on the negative effect When you are watching a wonderful football match on TV.Suddenly there are some advertisements.Being interrupted,you will be very disappointed and angry.What's more,there are some ads which are not good enough.some may mislead Children say ads on wine and cigarette Or some may frighten Children So I think we should reduce some ads which are harmful to Children and remain those which are connected with people's life Many people like reading.Some may read extensively and some may read intensively.Each way has its advantages and disadvantages.But reading extensively is a better way to read.First,nowadays,people are so busy that they read extensively.Because if you read extensively,you can use less time to read more books.So saving time is one of the advantages of this reading method.Second,with the development of the world,more books have been published.Everyday,there are hundreds of even thousands of books been If you read them intensively,you can't read all of them.Moreover,not all the books are useful and good.You may read some useless and meaningless books.But if you read extensively,you will have more choice of books.So you can choose the best one to read.In a word,reading extensively can save your time and energy.Moreover,it can help you to choose the best book to read.",6
590,"???""Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia,or mercy killing,is the practice of hastening a terminally and incurably ill patient's death in order to relieve his great pains and sufferings.Euthanasia is a controversial issue through out the world.In regard to the hopelessly ill patient's unbearable anguish,his family's emotional,physical and economic heavy burdens and the cost of society,euthanasia should be legalized in China.Euthanasia can relieve the suffering of the terminally ill patients both physically and mentally.Some people may argued that euthanasia is inhumane because it strips the patient's right to live.However,I would rather say that it is quite humane because it frees the patient from anguish and gives him back the dignity of death.Many euthanasias were committed under the strong request of the helpless patients.The reason why they chose death instead of life was that life was no longer enjoyable and meaningful for them.They couldn't do anything for society or theirfamilies.Every moment they lived,they suffered,both from their own physical pains and the emotional pains seeing theirfamilies suffered.Only death could give the peace and relief.Since death is their only enjoyable destination,it is quite humane to give them a ride and let them die with peace and dignity rather then dying bit by bit with all kinds of tubes plugged in their bodies.Euthanasia also can release the heavy burdens of the patients'families.The family suffers too when watching their beloved relative waiting for death painfully.They also have to look after the patient day after day.Some people even quit their jobs in order to take care of their relatives.China is a developing country.People are poorer than those in the developed countries.If they stop working,their incomes which support the basic life of the whole family will also stop.In addition,the medical fee for a terminal patient is very expensive.For example,a comatose patient costs26,000yuan a year.It is really a heavy burden for the family.Generally,a common family in Chinese family can not afford such expensive fee without the free-medical care service Therefore,hastening the death of a terminally ill patient liberates not only the patient himself but also his family.Euthanasia will save money,medical sources of the whole society.Artificially prolonging a patients life needs a lot of expensive medicine and equipments In the case of China,a large proportion of such medicine and equipments are imported so that they are even more expensive.Doctors and nurses are needed to treat the patient.However,for a patient who will never regain consciousness and die sooner or later.Such great efforts are in vain.In this sense,it is a waste of medical sources.It is more meanful to save these sources and help other curable patients.Under the free medical service system,euthanasia can save a large sum of medical cost for China.There is a Chinese saying""Fa Lui Bu Wai Hu Ren Qin"",which means that laws do not go beyond human feelings.Most of the people who committed mercy killing in America were aquitted by law.For instance,Dr.Herman N.Sanders,Mrs.Ross and Lester M.Zynamiak who killed his uncurable patient,her disformed baby daughter and his paralyzed brother in order to relieve their pains,were all aquitted.Since the motive of euthanasia is to relieve pains of patients and theirfamilies,and save money for the country,the cases of foreign countries proved that it was reasonable from the perspective of human feeling,euthanasia should be legalized in China.",6

773,"??Euthanasia Shouldn't Be Legalized In China Euthanasia is still a very contravercial issue in the world.Some countries accept it and legalize it,Uruguay.In other countries,euthanasia either exists but not legalized like in America,or is strongly against.I don't think euthanasia should be legalized in China.Euthanasia is also called mercy killing.It refers to hastening the death of terminally ill patient,usually under the patient's request and done through legal injection.It comes into existence because it puts an end to the graet suffering of the patient who sees no hope and to the burden of his family.Euthanasia is a good release in some cases,but to legalize euthanasia in China is another thing.It shouldn't be legalized in China.Life is very precious and also full of struggle,we can't easily give up hope.But man is often weak in mind when he is seriously ill.Legalizing euthansuia implies that man can take active measure to end his life and this may easily encourage patient's negative thoughts.When suffering from graet pain a lot of patients think they have incurable disease in fact it is not the case,instead many patients become seriously ill because of their worry.In this case,if euthanasia is legalized,a lot of patients will be induced to appeal to it.In fact confidence and optimism approved to be an important factor in the treatment of diseases.And some treatment does be hard or expensive,like chemical treatment.So we should encourage patients rather than induce them to give up hope.In countries where euthanasia is legalized,mercy killing is legal when the patient is terminally ill.But in fact it is very hard to determine whether a patient is ill or not.One factor is that in ost areas in China,especially the countryside,the medical equipments are still backward.It is not conscentious to decide a patient can't be cured under conditions or skills insufficient.Another factor is that mercy patients who are sentenced to death in hospital survive after their struggle.For example,Qiging has saved many cancer patients who had been dimmed no hope.There are also patients who lose senses,mind and become unconscious like a log miraculously recovered.For example,the famous Family magazine once tells a true story of a woman who takes graet care of her husband,who become unconcious after a serious car accident.The hospital can't cure his husband,while she doesn't give up hope.She learns from a doctor traditional Chinese medicine and keeps masaging her husband for several years,talks and sing to him everyday to wake him.And her confidence and persistence is finally rewarded.Euthanasia can be defined legal only when requested by the patient,agreed by family members and approved by doctors.This also makes legalizing euthansia not reasonable in China.China is developing country,a member of her citizens are still not rich.The traetment of a badly ill patient is a heavy burden to his family,especially in rural area.Under this circumstances,people who is not caring,moral will manipulate the law of euthanasia.He may force,of course not in obvious way,the patient to say that he want to end the suffering of disease,or delay the treatment until the patient is really incurable.If the patient is unconsious that it will be much easier.In fact newspapers have given similar reports.On the contrary,there are also some patients who are very considerate about his family and doesn't want to be hard for them,therefore asks for euthanasia even he is not willing to die.And this can't be a release of burden in real sense,no matter for the patient or for his family.Chinese law is established to protest citizens'right,and the legalization of euthanasia can not really be an exception.But according to the above mentioned factors,legalizing euthanasia can not really garantee the people'sright.Therefore euthanasia shouldn't be legalized in China.",6

859,"??Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia or mercy killing,so-called""a good death""is very popular in many western countries.Nowadays with the development of economy,many new concepts are introduced into China accompanied by the open policy.Among them,""euthanasia""is one of those special examples which still causes heat controversy.To the euthanasia,different people have different opinions.Some people think euthanasia is innocence for its purpose is to help to hasten the death of terminally ill patients.But the others say it is guilty because it deprives of human being's right to live on.In fact,both them are right.Obviously when an ill patient is terminal and has to depend on medicine to continue life and at the same time he has to endure great misery every day,at this case,use another way to hasten his death without any pain according to patient's will be better.In addition,it can release the hospital and the family's heavy burden.But one thing we may notice that is in China there aren't any laws to protect or against euthanasia.Therefore it's condemned to raise many unexpected questions.First,euthanasia means according to patient's will choosing another way to hasten patient's death without any pain.But,who knows the so-calledmercy killingis not deliberate if there is no clear law to protect it?Because the cost of the medical treatment for a comatose patient is so heavy burden for the patient's family.Although Chinese economy is developing quickly,there are many poor families.Maybe some form of murder might be conveniently dubbed""mercy killing""by unscrupulous persons.Secondly,if euthanasia isn't legalized,those people help the helpless patient to a good death may be regarded as murders.So that a series of questions will arise.Thirdly,every one has right to choose live or die,the traditional saying""debt is better than death""in fact is not so scientific.It is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond when people can never regain consciousness.This new view on death is practising in China.But there is still a long way to go for euthanasia to be widely and orderly accepted and practised.To make the euthanasia humane and protect people's will of living or death,to protect the social stability euthanasia should be legalized in China.",6

and ability in usual time but can't expect to tips about the test.So I believe in this proverb:""Haste makes waste"".Haste Makes China the old saying goes""haste makes waste"".It is the case.As we know we should advance step by step but not slowly when we do anything.Everyone wish to make progress quickly.It is only good wish We must know success is result of continuous efforts.Without hard work,no matter great goal we can't achieve.And we may become disappointed.For instance,we hope that we can lean English well.But don't take anxious None can learn something at once.We must practice reading,listening,speaking,etc.Every day we spare some time in studing English.And one day you will find your ability in English have improved.On the contrary,you will be sorry for your English.Haste Makes is a saying in China:""Haste makes waste"".What it means is that if you want to do something well,you should do it step by step.You should have enough practice to wait for the development of a thing.When you begin to do something,you will face to all kinds of difficults If you too you may neglect the importance of these questions.It will bring about a chain of bad reaction.So we say haste results in the failure.Our country is being constructed.We will spend many years in attaining our aim.To attain our aim we can't too haste We have spent nearly twenty years to develop the living standard of the Chinese.Because we have spent enough time we can gain the aim.We must cherish the hope that one day we will amply rewarded only if we put into enough efforts We can't forget the history in China.So we must remember that haste makes waste.If we remember it,we believe that China has a bright future.Haste Makes people know the saying:""haste makes waste.""But why:There are a lot of reasons.When a person expects to finish a job in a short time,he only cares for the speed,thinks""quick,quick"",and does the job carelessly.probably lead to failure.Another reason:a good plan is not made or well made.Fulfilling a job largely depends on a plan.According to the plan,people can do the job step by step.They can do it calmly not hurrily So when you do a thing hurrily people will tell you,""take it easy."" ""Haste makes waste"".It is really a truth.People should do things step by step of course,you can not neglect speed completely.You should combine speed with effect In this way,you can do it successfully.Haste Makes is well known to us that""more haste,less speed"".Because if we want to finish a task in less time,we will feel tense and our brain can't keep calm So the way of our thought will be massed and our wit can not be excited Thus,as a result we maybe spend more time but the qulity of the task we have done became poor.For example,when we have a exam in a class,we afraid that we have not enough time to do it.We will skim or scan the paper in order that we can save some time.However,if we do so,we will not understand the passage very well and the effect certainly will not be good.When you are about to do something,don't forget the word""more haste less speed"".Haste Makes are some sayings in our country.Many people maybe know the saying:Haste Makes Waste.It tells us that we can't do the things successfully if we haven't done the basic things well.It also tells we have only best wishes but we haven't best situations and enough time to do can't make our wishes really Haste only give us waste.As a college student,I think we should study well.But we shouldn't long for make a great progress without hard work.Or we must be defeated by the reality.We shall do the basic work well and be strick with us and listen to the lessons carefully.We must remember the saying:Haste makes waste.As a boss of factory he(she)must make his(her)products good quaities and mange his(her)workers well,then he(she)will make his(her)products known to people in his(her)country.Then the goal which his(her)products sold to out of the country can be true If he(she)doesn't do the basic work,we can say his(her)goal only a dream!If we catch the meaning of the saying,we can do our work efficientlly and make our good dreams true!Haste Makes proverb says""Haste makes waste"".This means the more haste you did things,the slower you will obtain your aims.For one thing,hasting always leads to give you intensity so as to forget something.For another,it usually disturbs your steps,and so on.These are the reasons why haste makes waste.For example,if you prepare for going to school in a hurry,you will forget the things that you must take such as books,pens and so on.For another example,if you haste in reading a abstract magazine,you will not get it across.Likewise,you usually fail to obtain in your much too high aim.Therefore,we must do anything step by step.Haste Makes always hope to do things quickly.Of course,it can save time and then to do other important things But most of us often forget a rule that haste makes waste.We do works as fast as we can,thinking that there are more works should be done after this.So we told ourselves to do it more quickly.Then,there comes the problem.Impatience usually appears at this time.The more we think about how to do it quickly,the worse we would get even worse Human's brain,at this time,always gives out some unnormal signals.It's always easy to know it but difficult to understand and cope with it.A worker slept latly the last night.But he must to worke the next morning.When he woke up,there's not much time left.So he got up in a hurry and went to work in few time After he arrived,he then found he forgot to take papers or something else which are more important.If he thought it,he couldn't make such mistake Another example is about students.When they are doing a paper,mostly at the end of the examination,they will lost patience and do paper uncounsiously Because they want to finish it in time.So we should not only remember that haste makes waste but also use it at correct time Time is time It would be more or less If we learn it by heart and tell ourselves not to be nerverse usually,we will get much from it.Haste Makes all know this old saying:""Haste makes waste"".But why?There are some simple reasons.When we are studying or working,we should do it step by step.If we can't walk,how can we run?The first step is the basic of the next step.For example,when we are building a skyscraper,we can't finish it in a short period.We must build it by bricks,one,two....If you just want to finish it.The quality will be bad.The result is obvious:the skyscraper is useless and we have to rebuild it.It's a waste!A waste of money,a waste of workforce,too.It's the same to studying.Only when you know the old knowledge can you learn the new knowledge.Thus,you can get a good grade.If you just want the speed,you won't succeed forever.And it's a waste of time,waste of life.Whatever things we do,we should tell ourselves.""Haste makes waste"",I believe that as long as we can study and work with enough patience in a long time,we can succeed one",5
894,"Global Shortage of Fresh People always think that they won't use out of fresh water.There are so much fresh water,such as rain,river,and they can use it at will.But they never think that fresh water is also limited,and if it is used out,what they can do.In fact,fresh water is of global shortage.In our lives,the need of fresh water is very large,our lives need fresh wate,industry needs fresh water,and many other fields also need water.But fresh water is limited,and there also lies the pollution of fresh water,so those make fresh water to be much shorter.The increase of the population and more water use in industry make the need about fresh water increase.What has been mentioned all request us to make a resolution on how to deal with the shortage of fresh water.In order to solve the problame about the shortage of fresh water,we must do as this.First of all,we must be quite aware of the limition of fresh water.Above that,we must be limited to use fresh water.Further more,we must decrease the pollulation of fresh water.Finally,we must find some new fresh water resource.Where there is no water,there is also no life.We must pay more attention to the shortage of fresh water.",4
895,"At same time,I'm doing my homework.This is a really particularly holiday,I can't laugh,but I will think about the happy things.the night of Saturday,we went to Yun Tai Garden.The moon was still round and bright.There many stars in the dark sky.To our joy,we found the Little Bear Stars,the North Pole Star was letting out its glaring light.the moon,we had the moon cakes.On that night,we also took photos and danced on the dance hall.Dance as I couldn't,I could learn.That was a wonderful night,I was struck.all those happy things had passed,I have to face the home work Though I want to play,I see study is the most important job for me.I will still accept the fact.",3
896,"Practice Makes If one person do a thing often and became very experience,then he or she will do it quickly and well.It is so-called practice makes perfect.It needs much time and energy to have this ability.But once you have this ability in one field,you will find it is easy to do something.For example,in our English studing,if we keep practising spoken-English usually and carefully,you will find that your ability of spoken-English is being improved gradurally.After you taking a great deal of practice and spending a lot of time,your ability of spoken-English will be at a higher level.You can talk with others freely,even with foreign friends.For another example,if you play football usually,you can control the ball freely,and you can pass the ball to teamates without see the ball.Practice makes perfect,it leads to a football star,such as Manadona.",4
897,"(t13-1)The19th century French writer Victor Hugo once said,""How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.""Indeed.And how much sadder it is to think that Hugo's words are not paid much attention to by us,people of the20th century!For in the20th century,humanity still turn a deaf ear to the groans and yells of nature.Thenineteenth century was one of prosperity for the industrialized world and one of disaster for Nature.Heavy smokes swarmed out of factory chimneys and polluted the air,and great noises aroused Nature from her peaceful sleep.For the first time in history,Nature,mother of human race,felt pains caused by her child's selfish action.But,as said by no one cared about her.Things have been getting only worse nowadays as far as I see it.Industrialization is sweeping the world and more and more factories are being built.As a result,pollution is as rampant as ever and Nature feels so in front of it.Rain forests are retreating before axes and electric saws;rivers and lakes find themselves having to swallow various poisons;sea water is often suffocated by a film of oil caused by leaks of oil tanks.Everywhere on the Earth,Nature is being maimed and poisoned,its groans lost in a sea of chants from thousands of triumphant machines,while we are enjoying ourselves and just have no time to listen to Nature's pleading.However,Nature has not given in.Right now she is taking a revenge on us for her""inhuman""treatment;she is rebelling against her children.Among other things,we find it hard to get any more clean water.We have begun to feel the pinch.And that was why the presidents of most our countries had an environment conference in1993,at almost the end of the century---we had found ourselves on verge of self-destruction.It was only then did we realize our foolishness.So,hopefully the next century will see ourselves reconciled with Nature.Let's lend an ear to our mother's complaints and remind ourselves""stop torturing our Nature!"" (t13-2)I think what Victor Hugo said in the19th century is still true nowadays.First,let's look at the wars in former Yogoslavia and other areas.Because of the war,large areas of farmland are wasted.This is followed by famine.People there have hardly anything to eat,not to mention sanitation and disease-control.So nature responds by hunger and epidemics.However the warlords refuse to heed the warnings of nature.They continue to fight for their own interests,caring nothing for the life of ordinary people.So the war must be stopped at once.All the just people must rise to overthrow the warlords.Let us live peacefully together.War means the doom of mankind.Peace means prosperity and future.Second,let's examine the world's greenhouse effect.Nuclear explosions throughout the world,continuous emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials bring about the depletion of ozone layer.Nature is calling out:the rising of temperature,extreme cold,more earthquakes and the gradual melting of the Antactica But people won't pay heed.They continue to do things at will.More nuclear explosions,inefficient use of burning fuels and so on Inmy opinion,all the unclear explosions must come to an end right away.Emission of carbon dioxide must be checked.Otherwise we will face intolerable heat and cold,more earthquakes and world-wide floods.Third,some people in the world have bad moral behavior.They use drugs,have sexual misconduct.Nature responds by Aids and other horrible diseases.But they won't heed.I think they must wake up immediately.They must know that the consequences of their misconduct are very serious.Millions of people have already suffered the disease Aids.Effective cures are yet to be discovered.So at present,all we must do is get rid of drugs(this,of course doesn't include the drugs in curing diseases)and behave properly,so that we can control Aids and other terrible diseases.(t13-3)Some people claim that with the arrival of science,technology and industrialisation,the world we live in is no longer what it used to be:the pristine state of nature decorated by the beautiful colours of nature and the melodious sounds of nature---blue skies,green land,clean water,drizzle and breeze.It was the romantic state of the world capable of intoxicating people and inspiring imagination.But now what comes into view in every industrialised region is a jungle of concrete skyscrapers,the snaking and interwoven network of motorways,crowded traffic and rushing people on the streets.Thepolluted air and water,and unbearable noise With such a big contrast,they conclude that the world is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination,and this trend of industrialisation must be checked if we are to live harmoniously with nature.We do not have to put industrialisation and preservation in the opposite positions.I do not think that industrialisation will necessarily deprive us of imagination and dreaming.On the contrary,science and technology can help us to build a better world for us to live in.They are not inherently contradictory.It is true that science,technology and industrialisation has brought some side-effects to modern society,and this,I believe,is not because of science and technology itself,but because of the misuse of science and technology by people who have done so out of selfish motives or who are near-sighted.Inmodern human history,science and technology has brought about far more advantages than disadvantages.Thanks to science and technology,human being has been liberated both physically and mentally.Machinery of all kinds and of all different purposes extends the physical power of human beings and computer science and technology serves as the extension of human mental power,which has greatly increased the efficiency of human work.People,more than ever before,have more leisure to enjoy themselves,traveling,participating in sports or doing something creative just for pleasure.Science and technology is capable of making people live meaningfully and comfortably.However,we must not overlook the side-effects of industrialisation.As is known,more and more realise the relationship between industrialisation and preservation of human environment,and measures have been taken to make a proper use of science and technology so that people not only can enjoy the benefits created by science and technology,but also the precious gifts donated by Nature.(t13-4)People nowadays seem to be living in a world of machines.At home we use all kinds of machines to take our place to do the house work,and at the office we press buttons to produce machines that will meet our needs.And people themselves live like walking machines.They eat the same kind of food that come out from factories,they dress the same clothes they drive cars instead of using their legs to go about,they live in buildings which are like matchboxes,they....It simply appears that human beings have been materialized and have lost their life and leaving no place for dream and imagination?Is it really so?Is it that the descendents of the people who lived on the Olympus Mountains and pictured so imaginative life of the Gods could not dream any longer?Is it that the descendents of the people who built the Great Pyramid could not imagine anything now?Is it that the descendents of the people who constructed the thrilling wonder,the Great Wall,could not creat a beautiful and lively life for themselves?People could not help to question it.People have never stopped to dream and to imagine As long as the live they will nurture their heart with cosy dreams and their head with fantastic imaginations.These two power are deeply rooted in the human body and live along with the human being.It is this power that enable people to survive the harsh environment and extends the life of human being for tens of thousands of years,and it is this power that drived the people to build such marvelous civilization on the earth,and it is power that makes the world become colourful,so animated and so worthful to live for a second of time So under the cold surface of machine actually the heart is beating.There is no need to worry about it.On the other hand,the science and technology and the product of the human being They are closely controlled by human being Thedesire to survive for the whole of the human society will lead people to control the industrilization before it's too late.And people will never wait passively to be destroyed by the material world they have created.Thecivilization are the basis for human being to creat more comfortable world not hindrence for their dreams and imaginations(t13-5)A century ago,Victor Hugo,the great French writer said:""How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.""A hundred years have passed,the world has changed greatly.But when I read this,it still sounds quite true to me.Never will I forget an incident that happened to me several years ago.In1987,I was studying at a university in a big city in the North.One winter Sunday,I got up later than usual.Opening the window,I found that it had snowed during the night.I put on my coat and went out for a walk.Theair was fresh.And the campus was all white with snow.Thebirds were singing in the woods and some children were snow-fighting on the play-ground.How lovely the world was,I thought.I walked out of the gate to the street.Turning a corner,I saw a large crowd of people.I walked to the crowd to see what was happening.I saw an old woman sitting on her bag.From the on-lookers talking I learned that she came from the countryside to see her son.When she got off the train she found that she had lost her money and her son's address.Not knowing what to do,she just sat there and waited.She was about fity and in old clothes.How sad and helpless she looked!I felt pity for her.I might help her.Just as I was about to talk to her,I saw that so many people were watching her indifferently.I shrank.I was afraid of being laughed at.On the second thought perhaps I was asking for trouble.I turned back and went away.So many years have passed,I can't forget that sad and helpless face.I don't know what happened to her that day.I regret that I did not help her.Sometimes I thought that I was a coward and that crowd were cruel and merciless people.From that day,I began to hate snow.How pure,how clean the snow is!But it covers up too many evils.Theworld does not appear to be the true one when it is covered with snow.Under the pure,white snow,there are still crime,famine and war.However,human beings are making progress in both sciences and morality.People are joining efforts to eradicate these evils from the world and there will be greater improvements in this world.I believe some day in the future,the world will be pure,clean and beautiful as snow.(t13-6)Inthe19th century,Victor Hugo said:""How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.""What about things nowadays?Nature has been crying for years,while some people pay heed volunteerly or reluctently some are still dormant.Nowadays every country and every region are eager to develop their economy.Thefundmental ways of economic development is to make progress in science,technology and industrialisation without sacrifying the enviroment Infact this principle has been ignored because of the urgency of the economical development.It is true that development is one of themes in the world,but we should realise that nature is the resource of our survival,and development,we will be,in fact have been,punished by nature if we refuse to pay attention to it.Some people want to achieve so called""high""profit,""high""speed,they try to expoil the natural resource only for their current benefit.They only think of today,not tomorrow.Only themselves,not others They are near-sighted indeed.Nature is mother of human being It is nature that offers us food,water,fresh air,sunshine and so on.We can get benefits from nature,but it doesn't mean that we can treat nature regardless of any natural principles.Through history studying we can see many natural punishment on human being for example,flood,forest fire,invasion of desert.There is an old Chinese saying:that is,to get all water out of a pool for fish Sure,you can get some fish for time being.Have you thought about what to get after that?Well,you have to starve and starve to death.Some people in the world are active in the environmental improvement.They are those who not noly know the problem,but also devote themselves in solving it ernerstly Enviromental problems are the problems belonging to the whole world.Every country and region should pay attention to them and work together against them.Many country should properly deal with the contradication of enviroment improvement and the economical development,and make these two factors stimulate each other.To solve these problem coporation should be reinforced among countries in the world.Advanced countries should help the developing countries in science and technology,finance to cope with the enviromental problems.With these the developing countries can really confront with them and solve them more efficiently.For those who are still ignorant of the enviromental problems,enlightenment and education is crucial.Every government has obligation to educate them and make them know the seriousness of these problems.For those who know the problems and still refuse to pay heed,regulations and law are efficient ways to make them not to makeprofits by violating rules.Finally I'd like to emphasize on the importance of nature to human being once more.Eviromental problem is one of the biggest problems,everyone should love nature as he loves his mother.Now there are some problems in nature just as there is some tird on our mother,take care of her,and wash her clean,and make her strong enough to live with us! (t13-7)Nowadays it is very necessary for us to pay more attention to Nature,particularly Natural protection and pollution.It is in fact,many decades ago We seldom came acrros the word.Nature problem on newspapers,broadcasting etc but now Everyday you can see and listen to the news about the protection and pollution of Nature.I think heeding Nature is a society problem.We must pay more attention to it like19th century's Victor Hugo.With the development of society,more factories are built up and industry have made a great progress,all aspects of society have also achieved Thelevels of the people's lives have greatly improved,but at the same time,Natural pollution also are becoming worse and worse.Many factories poured out waste things into the rivers and seas.Infactory areas and big cities,poisonous gases such as carbon dioxide,came from the factories or internal cambustion engine of the cars and trucks etc.are constantly sent out into the air.So many rivers and seas and some air are polluted.InMountain Areas many farmers have cut down forests when the flood is coming,the mountain slides accured friquently This brough many distruction to the farmers in all ways.and what is more As the reduction of the forests,the soil erosion also become fast.Natural balance have been destroyed.Many rear animals and plants have died away.all the facts above are very fital to our life,our constrution our science and technology and even our planet.So we must protect the nature scientific and make good use of it.I also would like to mention the land pollution and destruction.Many people have no sanitany manner they often throw out waste things and the land particularly in some cities you can see many waste and bad food and fruit coverings littered out in Every direction,and what is more,these cities are very crowd Some city dwellers may suffer from various strange diseases because of the bad living conditions.Particularly in summer,if we don't heed the nature and pay more attention to the natural pollution we mankind may eleminate one day.For protection of nature For our future Something mus be taken to protect and heed the Now many contries'goverment have made all kinds of laws to protect the nature,through the TV.Broadcasting and other ways.the idea of natural protection has come into many people's minds,so we can say the world now are fighting against pollution,at the same time man also protects and uses the nature in scientific mothods People also try their best to reduce the pollution resourses and many have trained their sanitory manners.So the idea of Victor Hugo to nature is very important to morden people.I think Everybody can understand this point and make a contribution in the protection of nature.(t13-8)Inthe19th century,Victor Hugo had said:""How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed,""which shows Hugo's anxiety and worry towards people's blind action to explore nature.Since the industry revolution,in order to make greaterprofit,modern man broke the harmonious relationship with nature,and seek wealth at cost of nature.They ignored the call of nature and the enviroment protection,desoultorily cutting down trees,giving off poinous gases and charging waste water into clean rivers.Nature had sadly witnessed human beings'ignorant and cruel behaviors,but now she begins to revenge herself on their20th's descendents.Nowadays the enviroment problem becomes very serious.Thecoverage of forest in the world is reducing rapidly,a lot of earth are being washed away,many acres of original fertile soil are becoming desert acid rain,air pollution appear in many places.We are losing our living space.Fortunately,people finally awares the importance of enviroment protection.Nowadays,throughout the world,many institutions and organs are founded to charge the enviroment problems.Factories begin to employ the anti-pollution devices,farmers are encouraged to use scientific method to farm,the blind behaviour of cutting down forest is forbidden,enviroment protection are widely publicized and from primary school children begin to receive the enviroment education and every citizen is encouraged to plant trees to make the country green.Ina word,the people in20th century are trying their best to explore natural resources reasonably and protect their living surrounding Although the phenomenon of blindly destroying nature still exists in some areas We can safely believe with the efforts of the people all over the world,we will surely renew our homonious relationship with nature.(t13-9)Victor Hugo,a French Writer who lived in the19th century once said:""How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.""What a wise and provident person Victor Hugo is!He could realize the important of environmental protection.Can we be justified in paying no heed to keeping the balance of nature?Of course To keep the balance of nature,isn't equal to abandon ourselves on the mercy of nature.But we can't turn a blind eye to environmental degradation.Otherwise it will be We Who take the punishment.Forests,birds,water,land,sky,Ocean and sea are all our best friends.They can provide a favourable living condition,for us.if we utilize them properly But there are some problems we are often negligent of,in other words,many of us only take advantage of them,they know or they are reluctant to protect them.InBrazil,Deforestation is.seen everywhere,Brazil.abounds with the world's largest.tropical forest.Zones Owing to people's overuse and damage.Now,Brazil's tropical forest.is on the sharp decline.As is patent to all.forest plays an important and necessary role in keeping the balance of nature.It can.provide us quality wood.and.beautify our environment.It can.also.shield.off the wind....Inmany developed countries and developing ones,Land is also worsening.Inorder to increase.grain production.Some countries.spray too.much poison and.fertilizer.into.the fields,which,in a sense,increases the grain production,but.in turn.does a lot of harm to land quality.From an overview point what they have done,does no good to nature.Rare.animals are being slaughtered.on a large scale.Giant Pandas leopards,whales,penguins and other rare animals are on the edge of extinction.This,in a way,steems from.the environmental degradation.Many plants these animals live on.exist.no longer How can they remain alive.All the things in nature are interdependent.What should we do.in face of environmental.degradation?Can we continue to turn a deaf ear to worldwide deforestation.Vandalism.and degradation.?Theanswer is""No"".What we should do at once,is we.should.bring home to people the importance of keeping the balance of nature,and also,we should set up.sanctuary.and take effective measures to give those people.who.don't protect the environment punitive punishments.Only by doing so can we.keep our.nature from being damaged.and contaminated.Some countries.such as Sweden.Switherland and Singapore,have set good examples for us in.keeping the balance of nature.We should learn from them.Inretrospect,Victor Hugo.could.urge us to.protect our environment.We should be guilty of what we have done to nature.Theworld is developing by leaps and bounds.China.is transitting from.commodity economy market economy.On the one hand.we should.develop.our economy rapidly.On the other hand.we have full reason.to.pay heed to nature.Environment is our best friend.It is our best choice---to protect the environment.to keep the balance of nature.(P.S.environment and nature.in a general sense.refer to our surroundings).",6
