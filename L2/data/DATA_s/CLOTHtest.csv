Suffering  Growing up is not easy and pain is part of our lives. Almost everyone gets hurt. Take a deep breath and give life a big smile when we suffer pain.
Personal Responsibility   We each have a choice to be either a someone or a loser. We should have responsibility for the choices we make. What we will have in the future depends on what we do with .
Self-confidence  We should believe we can do something well. Nothing in the world is difficult for the man who is confident of himself.

Your reasons will   information  ; they will include reading or studying ""to find out more about"", ""to understand the reasons for"" and ""to find out how"".

I'd better check that date,"" or ""But there are some other facts to be considered!"" You don't just sit there acquiring information; you are also   added   between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence while opinions are one's own personal reactions.",4

800,"Apes and human beings share a lot in common when it comes to behavior. The evidence taken from the observation of the behavior of apes and children suggests that there are three causes for the outbreak of fighting and the exhibition of   sank   by individuals.
One of the most common causes of fighting among both children and apes was over the
  husband   of external objects. The argument over the ownership of any desired object--food, clothes, toys, females, and the affection of others--was sufficient reason to   turn to   force. In a case of monkeys' disagreement over females, thirty females were killed. Two points are of particular interest to notice about these fights for possession.
In the first place the fights are often carried to such an extreme that they end in the
  also  destruction of the objects of common desire. Toys are torn to pieces and females are killed.
In the second place it is observable, that   that   occurs when an object is desired by only one person or by someone else. There were many cases where toys and other objects which had been thrown away as useless were   someone   defended by their owners when they became the object of some other child's desire.
Another cause of aggression is the tendency for children and apes greatly to   with   the invading of a stranger into their group. A new child in the class may be laughed at, isolated, and disliked. A new monkey may be bitten to death. It is interesting to note that anger occurs when a stranger comes from the   slowly   species. Monkeys do not mind being   pulled   by a goat or a rat. Children do not object when animals are introduced to the group. As a matter of fact, such newcomers are often   rushed  . But when monkeys meet a new monkey or children a strange child, aggression often occurs. This strongly suggests that the reason for the aggression is fundamentally possessiveness. The   information   of the newcomers is feared. The present members of the group feel that there will be more competitors for the food or the attention of the adults.
Finally, another common source of fighting among children is a frustration or failure in their own   choice  . A child will be stopped either by   tired   causes such as bad weather or illness from doing something he wishes to do, for example, sail his boat or ride the bicycle. Sometimes the activity may be   jump   because of the opposition of some adult. The child may also frustrate itself by   apologies  , through lack of skill or strength, to complete successfully some desired activity. Such a child will then in the ordinary sense become ""naughty"". He will be in a bad or unfriendly temper.",4

958,"Sometimes people call each other ""scared-cat"", but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its blood- stream.
    Although the cat doesn't   _  this, its body is
getting ready for action.
    If the danger continues, this animal will do one of the two things. It will   _  itself, or it will run away as fast as it can.

Does this mean that it's smarter always to   _  our
feelings? No! If you  _  feelings of anger,

    You can try to treat emotions   as if  they were

Much time and effort has been devoted to researching the mental health benefits of flexible work environments, but can the ability to leave work early to watch your son's soccer game, or arrive at the office a bit later in the morning in order to   see to  some personal matters, have broader physical health benefits  sank  making you feel a bit less tired?
According to new research published in the Cochrane Library's Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, it seems so. In a review of 10 previous studies examining the health effects of flexible work conditions for more than 16,000 people,   husband  from the U.K.'s Durham University and University of Newcastle, as
well as the University of Montreal, found that flexible work schedules -- when
employees can  also  their starting
times, for example -- were associated with improvements in a person's overall
health. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, in all of the studies included in the
review, researchers found no evidence for  that  effects of more flexible work schedules.
This initial analysis was intended to throw light on the potential health benefits of flexible work options, which are increasingly    someone  throughout
Scandinavia, and have recently gained some ground in the U.K.  For example  , last April, the British government  with  a
policy that allowed parents of children ages six and under to request flexible
work arrangements to include parents of children ages 16 and younger. In the

workplace flexibility -- as companies  pulled  to
reward employees with bonuses  or raises may      turn to  other forms of
compensation , Reuters reported early last year.
Previous research too, of course, has indicated the benefits of flexible work environments toward positive mental health outcomes. And while these latest findings are promising, the researchers stress that more study is vital to understanding the detailed    rushed  between flexible work
and improved health outcomes. To truly  information  the
benefits of flexible working conditions, the researchers say, additional study
analyzing health outcomes among a wide  choice  of
workers -- from high-ranking executives to hourly employees -- is  tired  , which helps to gain a deeper understanding of the issue, and
to shape future workplace policy.",4

1191,"In the 1960s, Douglas McGregor, one of the key thinkers in the art of management, developed the mow famous Theory X and Theory Y. Theory X is the idea that people instinctively  sank  work and will do anything to avoid it. Theory Y is the view that everyone has the potential to find satisfaction in work.
In any case, despite so much evidence to the  husband  , many managers still agree to Theory X. They believe,  for example  , that their employees need constant supervision if they are to work effectively, or that decisions must be imposed from  also  without consultation. This, of course, makes for authoritarian   managers.
Different cultures have different ways of  that  people. Unlike authoritarian management, some cultures, particularly in Asia, are well known for the consultative nature of decision-making--all members of the department or work group are asked to  someone  to this process. This is management by the collective opinion. Many western companies have tried to imitate such Asian ways of doing things, which are based on general  with  . Some experts say that women will become more effective managers than men because they have the power to reach common goals in a way that traditional  slowly  managers cannot.
A recent trend has been to encourage employees to use their own initiative, to make decisions on their own without  pulled  managers first. This empowerment   has been part of the trend towards downsizing:  rushed  the number of management layers in companies. After de-layering in this way, a company may be  information  with just a top level of senior managers, front-line managers and employees with direct contact with the public. Empowerment takes the idea of delegation   much further than has  choice  been the case. Empowerment and delegation mean new forms of management control to  tired  that the overall business plan is being followed, and that operations become more profitable under the new organization, rather than less.
Another trend is off-site or  jump  management, where teams of people linked by e-mail and the Internet work on projects from their own houses. Project managers evaluate the   apologies  of the team members in terms of what they produce for projects, rather than the amount of time they spend on them.",4

I find the research   _   because I get to find out about what new   _   and technologies are being developed to deal with environmental problems.  _   to working in a shop, I find this job is quite rewarding, since I am   _   something that can not be obtained from books.
I also   _   many of the Green Initiatives events. These events are one of the best things about volunteering because I get the   _   to network and meet 
  _   people who have ideas about   _   to make Shanghai 'greener.'
When I am at the events, we often have Chinese speakers, and so the events have also been an interesting   _   experience for me.
One of the biggest differences between my experience   _   at Oxfam and Green Initiatives is the motivations of the people you meet and work with. At Oxfam, the motivations were varied. People were there to 'do their bit for charity,' to earn a living, or   _   because they could only afford the things we sold.
Speaking to people in China, motivations are also varied but the main driver is the environmental degradation, such as air pollution, which affects, or at least concerns, many of these people in their everyday lives.

the greatest oceans. Now, however, there are people who look for an immediate
pleasure from a  also  activity which
may only last a few minutes or even  that  .

high place about 200 meters above the ground with an elastic rope  with  to your ankles. You  slowly  at up to
150 kilometers an hour until the rope stops you from  pulled  the ground. It is said that 2 million people around the world have
now  rushed  bungee jumping. Other activities,  information  most people would say are as dangerous as bungee jumping,  choice  jumping from tall buildings and  tired  into
the sea from the top of high rocks.
Why do people take part in such activities as these? Some psychologists  suggest that it is because life in   jump  societies has become
safe and boring. Not very long ago, people's lives were constantly under  apologies     .They had to go out and hunt for  address  , and
life was a continuous battle for survival.
Nowadays, according to many people, life offers   happy  excitement. They live and work in  ly
safe condition; they buy food in shops; and there are doctors and hospitals to  look after  them if they become ill. The answer for some of these people is to  seek for  danger in activities such as bungee jumping.",4
